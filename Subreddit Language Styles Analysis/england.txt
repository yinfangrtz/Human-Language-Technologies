Greetings from Saudi Arabia. During this lock down I have decided to make 150 dishes from around the world. Behold: Scones.

It’s pronounced “scones!”
I like it! Especially how you sneakily avoided conflict by not putting the jam and cream on the same scone, thus avoiding the 'which comes first' debate.
really, really good-----------------well done
Fun fact, it's the fastest cake in the world.
You have done this nation proud. Now eat them at private tea party to finish the job.
What Saudi food would you recommend we try to make in reciprocation?
fantastic
What goes first the cream or the jam
That's outstanding! Your fried rice looks great too, I'm looking forward to the next installment.

Thank you for not putting lazy-raisins in it.
fantastic
Mmmm.
You rock! Waiting to see what you make next. It all looks excellent so far. Super idea!
They look awesome!
Good effort how did they taste.
Oh gosh now I'm hungry....hungry for SCONES. 

such a luxury item. 

These look brilliant.
You've made me want scones now
Amazing, can’t wait to see what else you bake :)
Cream goes underneath jam. You Cornwall weirdos can kick rocks. DEVONSHIRE STRATS.
These look great, only this morning I asked my mum to make scones, she hasn’t so far. Please send some for a poor English guy in lockdown.
These look amazing! Tbh I find the whole debate about 'which comes first' rather silly - as long as you have loads of lovely jam and cream it doesn't matter!

Did you find them hard to make? And did you enjoy eating them?
Can you post some to me! They look delicious!
This is amazing! Do you have a list? Can we suggest things? I’m Northern Irish so (representing all Irish food - no politics here) can I suggest potato bread, wheaten soda bread, or Irish stew?
This cooking journey that you've come out looks amazing , definitely following to see your other wonders
Ah, a man/woman/being of culture!
Would ye mind sending us the recipe you used?
These look delightful! Good job mate.

I checked out your reddit page and the "150 dishes from around the world" is probably the best thing I have seen on this site!
Bloody good job, old chap!

I’m drooling at the mouth for one of these delights! 
Any effort is a good effort (any culture), but you’ve done an excellent-looking job.
"Behold: Scones." Is the best way they've ever been presented to me.
They look great!
As someone who's been to Saudi and tried your desserts, it's nice to see someone reciprocating :)
They look amazing! You've made me hungry.

What other dishes have you made?
They look fantastic! My mum couldn’t make them better than that.
Pronounced "scones" or "schooones"
Good effort. They look almost perfect.  


Almost because you seem to be missing raisins and cherries in there.
These looks spot on. Hope you enjoyed them!
delete this because now I'm hungry
Good job! Did you enjoy them?
/r/CasualUK would like to know what that cream is, please.
Good effort
They look superb, well done! 

To enjoy them at their best you need proper clotted cream, which might be tricky in Saudi Arabia, but you can make it if you have patience. Clotted cream completely transforms scones into something sublime; no other cream is remotely as good. Add in some high fruit, high quality jam and a decent strength cup of English Breakfast tea and you’re onto absolute ambrosia. 

Half the fun for a first time eater is trying out cream-then-jam and jam-then-cream and deciding which one you like the best! 

Oh, and try making the scones with sultanas in too!
They look great, so well risen!

Also I'm delighted to see you go the same way I do when it comes to the jam and cream debate. Enjoy!
Bet they were scone in no time!...what you guys looking at!
These are great, Love seeing the other foods you’re making :)

Have any of the ingredients for them been hard to find so far?
They look amazing
Good work laddy
These look great! I suggest you try a cheese scone next time.
Looks like you did a great job. I hope you enjoyed them.
They look very good but...... Fruit?   Butter?
Clotted cream darling.. cant have my scones without them يعطيك العافية 👌
They look spot on.  I see you avoided the minefield that is cream or jam first!  Always jam first...it's just a lot easier IMO.
That's a clever way to avoid the ongoing English civil war over whether it's cream or jam first.
I love this idea! Such a great way to find new foods you love.
they look a little moist [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e-jXsTlrHc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e-jXsTlrHc)
The scones look great! 

I'm not sure that you've used the correct type of cream though, that doesn't look like clotted cream to me. Are you able to buy clotted cream in SA? Did you try to make your own?
*Silently screams*
They look great! Add sultanas next time for a more authentic look!
They look amazing! I hope you enjoyed them.
Ooh yummy
They look great, did you like them? How did they go down?
American here. TIL how scones are pronounces (which is not how it's spelled) and I realize that they look similar to what we call "biscuits" in the American South. The recipe is obviously different, but if you want to try a similar (but very different) result, you can make a plate of biscuits and in them (like a sandwich) have a fried chicken fillet, eggs and bacon, or have it smothered in white gravy.

If you find a "biscuit" recipe that looks like a sweet snack, it's not correct (we call those "cookies").
Good shit
Good one lad!
Cracking effort.
Looks great but

Where are the raisins
These look amazing! ❤️
they look amazing. fantastic effort!
Mmmmm lovely
That looks heavenly! Are you posting your other dishes too? Would love to see them!
Bravo, these look great!
These look amazing!!
They look really nice. Good effort. Do they taste as good as they look?
what recipe did you use?
As a Brit, thank you, and I hope you enjoy!
Looks great! I want some now haha
Biscuits?
Any word on the Newcastle United takeover?
They go best with a pot of English breakfast tea with milk.
That had better be cream first!
Awesome! r/mexicanfood is waiting for you!
How are we all pronouncing it, S'cone' or S'gone'  
I'm team S'cone'
They look really good mate. Keep it up and enjoy.
يشبه البيسكت الأمريكي، هل نفس طريقة  الصنع والطعم؟
Its just a fucking biscuit with jelly
Silly American here are scones not from England?
We love you England. A lot of Italian have you like second mom. Nice game, you was great!

Lovely post, thank you. Thank you for a great game and well done for winning. Fuck the haters.
Good Game 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️🇮🇹
Glad to see that someone from the continental Europe that wasn’t gloating on us and rubbing it against us. You deserves this, and very well played. We will see you in 2022 WC, hopefully with a better and wiser team. Ciao. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇮🇹
[deleted]
The most confusing bit for me is the nationalities here on reddit gloating we lost, and saying it's good we lost as we'd be insufferable winners.. 

When they are from nations that didn't make it to the finals, or didn't even make it to the knock out stages.. 

They're genuinely being bad winners, despite being losers.


Anyway, GG Italy. Southgate made some poor decisions, but you guys controlled the game from about minute 60. 

To all other nations, go fuck yourselfs. We trounced you still.
"you was great" is what expect from a fellow drunken Italian
Italy deserved it. Gutted, but it's a fair result I'd say.
No hard feelings! You guys played excellently!
I don't think this post represents the mainstream narrative
WEEE ARE THE CHAMPIOOONSS
Viva Italia.
sure you don't know how to lose🇮🇹
Honestly most of England fans have been disrespectful but at least you are not all the same
IT'S COMING ROME🇮🇹💙
Hahahaha
I am Italian and I would like to say one thing.
it was truly a sign of contempt to take off the medal.
then you are a lot of saints, but you have beaten and beat up the Italian fans.

" You was great "

Were you talking about the football team or the fans?
A CASAAAAAAA
I'm in America, so I have to look to you guys for some type of sanity, ok? So thank you for being so civil, and I think both teams did a really good job yesterday. 💙
So was you Italy!
So was you Italy!

I am Italian and I hate England! 
Go Italy!!!!
It's coming Rome, I hate:"It's coming home

Merry traitormass peasants.
Happy Traitors Day
I’m American and think this is hilarious.
We still believe
I'm an American and my husband is British American, we had st. George's flags up all Euros and took them down for today. We put up US flags to celebrate but the St. George's will be going back up tomorrow!

Highlight of the day: Takeaway driver made a friendly face towards the flags and and I laughed and said Happy Fourth of July! (My accent usually gives the game away) He smiled looked at the flag and said 'Yeah! Happy Birthday!'
🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹 ITALIA NUMERO UNO!!! 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹

Spoiler: it did not came home
Lets go Italy hahahahaha these memes gonna stop immediately 😂

English fans can be pricks, but not all of us are like that.

It’s currently on-trend to shit on England, England fans, English football, anything English really. A completely bigoted view that has unfortunately been taken up by a significant number of shouty xenophobic nations, I guess it’s a convenient way to distract from their own nastiness. Can you imagine the outrage if it was the other way round? Anyway…let’s be perfectly’English’ about it; ignore it, welcome like-minded tolerant people, complain about the weather, but more importantly let the boys do the talking on the pitch this Sunday….and then look forward to a new wave of anti-English yet somehow strangely accepted sentiment when we lift the trophy on Sunday
Turkish fans booing the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks is a particularly egregious example. 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-friendly-turkey-idUSKCN0T62LY20151117
I agree 100% with that pic. I'm french and I'm with you guys. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't deserve your victory because you do. I will not be fooled, for a long time many people have been taking advantage of the smallest mistakes from fans and then exaggerating it to put you down and bashing you. Don't ever let that happen, you are a strong nation with a great culture and history. I hope at all costs your victory, it would be one of the most beautiful things in the history of football to win almost 50 years after (the last great victory you had was in 66 I think) and moreover at Wembley in the largest stadium in the country!

I hope to see many smiles after the Eurocup in England !

Love you all! From France !
Finally someone else mentions it!
Yeah this needed to be said, since brexit there’s a lot of hate on the European sub against England and it’s palpable.
Ah, don’t let some cunts on the internet get to you because they saw a few cunts make a tweet and heard a few cunts booing. Let’s all just have some banter and a laugh shall we?
As it turns out people don't need much incentive to crap on England. Not saying there's nothing to criticize but there's a lot of people really grasping at straws at the moment.
People always say stuff like 'It's just a few fans' except when it comes to England where apparently it means the whole country is that way.
I live in Denmark currently, yesterday was.. Interesting
'Stuards' lol
Fuck the lot of them, ignore the keyboard warriors talking shit online and if we bring it home shove it in their faces for the rest of time 🤞🤞
I don’t get the anti England thing I’m seeing all over Reddit. At this point it seems like an excuse to make a meme. I’m from the US and  I’ll be rooting for England, bring it home lads!
Cuz England is an island ,island means small to idiots
If you're English lads just remember

1. They hate us because at some point we dominated them

2. God save the queen

3. If you let these foreign knobheads get to you remember your grandad uppercuted Hitler and man up

4. Footballs coming home
Or [Scotland fans booing the English/British national anthem in 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4fbWssQ0OQ)

It's not hard to find idiots amongst pretty much any group of fans (or any large enough group of people).
That's kinda just the way it is unfortunately, your media make a huge deal about your fans bad behaviour, and since it's in English the whole world can see it.

So idk, learn Welsh or smth.
Did u put this in r/memes? Them idiots need to see this.
Tldr humans are cunts
“All English fans bad” is not the same as “only English fans bad”, the examples you show are examples on the second one, not the first, oh and btw I’m of course not saying every English fan is bad lol, just making the difference clear
Perfect post, they will prob come up with some shite excuses for most of these specially the Italian one since they will magically be supporting them to feel included in a group.
english scum is at it again, attacking women and children. total cowards. 

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jul/09/danish-woman-claims-assault-by-england-fans-after-semi-final
You don’t justify hate with hate,
🤡👉🏠
As a dane i wanna say yea we had an situation in 2000 when a drunk fan of ours tan on the field and we got the automatic loss. But what’s tripping us is that we don’t see that justice here when our goalie gets lasered in his fucking head, it would only be fair if we got the automatic win,
Half of these are just straight up lies. For example, Spanish fans never booed the Italian national anthem. Second point: Hungary and Azerbaijan not wanting LGBT stuff is not the same as disrespecting a country's national anthem. If you're so angry about it, go complain to FIFA for hosting 2022 in Qatar. Third point: Russian fans don't boo black players just for being black. Again. Straight up lie.

Take your delusional national stereotypes elsewhere. Anglo Saxon people are far more racist than Slavs and Southern Euros.
[removed]
Hey I get you are trying to prove a point and all. But I dont belive we the Danes where booing doing the Finnish National Anthem. I'm sure we have some rotten eggs, but I would like to only take the blame for stuff we actually did.

Here is a video of the Finnish Anthem at the match.
https://youtu.be/7kD9su2fazA
Sometimes, not so small, at least in the stadium.
lol half of the Iranian stand literally did a fucking nazi salute at a germany game, yet 5 idiots on twitter is worse
.
Congratulations England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿, from Denmark 🇩🇰!
You bastards! 😉
Nice to see a respectful comment for once, cheers and you played well.
Thanks dude! Well played!
I know a lot of people who disrespected Denmark before the game. However, you guys were quality and frustrated us for a lot of the game.

Good luck in the future and Kasper was mint.
You are an intelligent team with heart. Well played and good sportsmanship you knee clapping losers ;)
Best team we have played. You are a top team 🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰
Great game.
You did great, congratulations on getting so far!
some of the best defence I seen this tournament Defended like hell what a goalkeeper Kasper is
Congratulations, England!

  -- Cincinnati
England and Denmark...brothers.
if anyone had to knock us out, it should've been you lot! 

you should all be proud of not just your team but also as a nation for how you rallied around them after the tragedy in the first match and got you to the semi finals.
Well played! You guys definitely have done really well this tournament and it sucks we had to face each other. I’m sure you’ll get us next time!
Gutted we had to beat you guys, Schmeichel played a blinder too
Good game! Glad to see a good sport!
Not a comfortable moment in the pub for us apart from the last 5 minutes. Seriously well played your side, tonight and throughout. You were the dark horses after all 🙂
Brilliant  game...The Danes were every bit our equal.
The good thing about yesterday's game is that no side can really claim themselves to be far superior. Well played both of you, cheers from Sweden

And I'm also glad you annoying danes didn't win ;)
My thoughts on the match, should anyone care:

I think it was far more equal than most had anticipated, but especially by the second half, it was clear that England had the strongest team, and Denmark was under heavy pressure for long stretches.

On the other hand, I think the Danish team did really well with the ressources they had. I don't think there can be any doubt that Damsgaard's free kick was by far the best goal of the match. And I think the English team had some luck with the penalty kick -- first in getting it at all, second that Kane managed to score on the rebound. 

With a bit of luck (good or bad, depending on your perspective) I think Denmark could have held on, and the match would have gone to penalties ... and I would have liked our chances if that'd happened. No disrespect to Pickford, but Schmeichel was on fire tonight, and I think that would have given us a slight edge. 

I think it could have gone either way, but in the end the best team won. Congratulations again.
A lot of people gave England shit before the game because of a couple of shitty fans with unacceptable behaviour (especially in ENG 2 - 0 GER).

If you hate the England team purely for that, you’re no better than those shitty fans.
Good sport!
Schmeichel 👌👌
Thank you, you played fantastically!
How very gracious of you. 👍
Tough game today, you lads played well and gave England a run for our money. Denmark are looking so strong lately, you're definitely a squad to watch in future tournaments
England should be part of Denmark again as Brexit ain't wot it was advertised as on the telly bruv. UK sucks and EU love simple as
Thanks we will win
Through the gates of hel
Your boys played amazing and did you proud 🇩🇰 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Thanks bro should be proud of your team, amazing achievement xxx
Even though we tried to blind your goalkeeper when Kane took the winning penalty you played phenomenally, good luck in your matches to qualify for Qatar
Tbf, that shouldn't really have been a pen. There was one later on that was way worse
Fuck Kasper Schmeichel he dared asked has it ever come home . 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
dont congratulate that scum. their disgusting behavior against our fans at the stadium, deserve all the hate in the world. they were even spitting in the face of children, because of their idiotic sports ball. fk those cowards.
[removed]
Still, spectators behaved like scum.
Thanks pal, you were one hell of a side 😎
Tah mate good match
High stakes

Oh God - the England team have GOT to win.
Ah, but they don't say where we have to take him.
If that doesn't spur the lads on nothing will!
The guys a cunt he belongs in neither country put him on an island somewhere on his own. An island like in those horror movies with a lighthouse and constant strange beings to kill
It’s a deal 🤝 we gonna win com in engorlend! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿😀😀😀
If it's a draw we drop him in the middle of the Atlantic
What if it ends in a draw? He goes to Iran?
Fifa are corrupt enough without giving people reasons to throw games
where do I know him from. His name is so familiar I’m a fking idiot
This is fair
Might fit in better in Qatar.
Please england win
Who’ll take him?
They tied. So now what?
A draw is a win for the US right?
Great to see this :)

You won’t see this trending on /r/europe lol
Is there a source that isn’t ladbible?
Sad that they need to
10 million quid is enough to fund the entire NHS for slightly less than 25 minutes.
The government should be founding it. If they normalised donations from a football team or and oldman doing laps of his garden they are slowly shifting the responsibility.
Perhaps the government will take their lead.
Boris is creating GoFundMe for NHS at this very moment
To be clear it looks like they are [donating to the NHS Charities](https://www.nhscharitiestogether.co.uk/) not the core NHS. So the money goes to better staff facilities, patient wellbeing, etc.
Might as well just set light to it.
Oh here we go, protect the NHS again
Still donating it? It's coming Rome 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
They'll need it for all the choking they do.
Lets hope the fine for having a fan using a laser pointer is bigger. Go Italy!!!🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Domani ve spacchiamo
People are gonna cheer at this then keep voting for boris like it's normal
"Donating to the NHS" is so horribly misunderstood. Nobody, not Captain Tom or the England football team can dontate to the NHS for medical treatment - it's prohibited. NHS Charities is where the money goes, which is mostly there to support staff, and it now has more money than it knows how to spend. 

My friend's hospital had to donate their 'wellbeing packs' to the local police (who also didn't really want them) because, thanks to Captain Tom, they'd received more water bottles, sandwhiches and colouring books than any grown adult could possibly want. I thought at first that they must be doing more than just giving goodie bags to nurses, but after reading more about them, that is actually the main accomplishment they advertise.

Now is it a terrible thing that we're throwing freebies at nurses... probably not... but it's about the last thing most people have in mind when they're celebrating or working towards a large donation 'to the NHS'.
Hello from Sweden! I made a map of England on my typewriter, made up of city and town names. Hope you like it, I’m really happy about how it turned out!

Amazing!
beautiful work! Very impressive and I love the style :)!

Have you thought about doing a full UK or a Great Britain one? Would be interesting to see how you show signify the different countries.
I made by first making the shape of England in notepad on a computer, and then scouring Google Earth for towns and cities that would fit in nicely. After about 20 hours of work I had replaced all the placeholder letters, and I could type it out using a typewriter from the 70s. I then scanned it and sent off for printing - so if you’re really interested you’re welcome to check out my [Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1094460360/england-map-poster-made-out-of) :) Otherwise have a good day!
Looks really good!
Brilliant.
That’s really nice and I would buy that. Do you have an Etsy store?
This is awesome! You could honestly sell prints of these!
Please mark as NSFW, it says *Scunthorpe* on there!

&#x200B;

JK, nice work and cool to see my obscure hometown is in there :)
Reminds me of when I was 10 and I had to make a map of the U.K. with places I could name and I got in trouble because I could name lots of random towns and villages in Essex and South Yorkshire because that’s where my grandparents lived (as well as all the normal places like Cardiff, Glasgow, Edinburgh, etc.)
Really nice! I love Sweden too!
Brilliant work!
I see my pokey home town.  This is cool
Very artistic ❣️
Very cool.
First town mentioned! Love it great work.
I love this
Nice work
That’s incredible! Excellent work!
That's class mate!!
Love it!
That’s brilliant, great work
I love this! Very unique and you're clearly really talented. Keep it up!
I'd be impressed if you did this on Microsoft Word, but the fact you did it on a typewriter with no ctrl - z is just astonishing! Thoroughly well done!
Berwick is in Scotland not England
Thanks for putting Coventry on the map most people forget about us

Winter in England

Where’s this?
I miss snow
Finally??
Where snow
Well it's just pouring down in Stoke atm. 

Hopefully a bit of snow soon though, got to look after the misses while she has gallstones... (I'm still not 100% wtf it is lol) so it would be a nice view.
I’m assuming this isn’t current.
Didn't know snow existed here
It's not going to be above freezing here for the next week.

Lowest I've known it is minus 14. That's with wind chill. I've also been out hiking in such temps. Its brutal and not fun. Never again.

30 years ago we were living in East Lothian. The winters were brutal. It's snowed for the majority of winter.

Fast forward to now and the winters are relatively benign. The speed of climate change is terrifying. Into December there's still summer flowers in the garden. In fact, next summers flowers are out.

It's not a good sign that winters are so benign now. Far from it.
Looks really similar to Blockley in the Cotswolds
