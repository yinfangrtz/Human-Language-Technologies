The President‚Äôs dog, S√≠oda, has passed away. RIP S√≠oda.

All dogs go to heaven. Rip
State funeral I say
I think we should get a statue of this dog put into Phoenix park
Ah bollocks, fuck you 2020.
A once in a lifetime dog really, she just stayed with Miggled all the time be it in a big event or just hanging out. Great dog. Now to go chase some postmen in heaven.
There's 17,000 people in this subreddit now

Do I put out the good cups or what?
S√≠oda was the best dog. Poor Br√≥d. Poor Miggeldy.
Sioda and the Presidents dogs have done so much for this country, they brought smiles to every visitor we had.  Always being proud to see them talked about by other countries.

Thoughts with you Michael D RIP Sioda
RIP S√≠oda. Hope Br√≥d is okay.
This fucking year man

Rainbow Road awaits
Condolences from Singapore. The dog melted hearts around the world, today the world mourns with Ireland. 

RIP S√≠oda
I'm actually fucking crushed, lads. This one's for S√≠oda.
Oh my fucking heart is breaking for them. And the nation.   


RIP S√≠oda. I'll give my dog extra scritches today in your honour.
Hey r/Ireland, I‚Äôve never been to your country, nor did I know before now of Sioda. But, any man or woman who ignores convention, preferring to honour the love of the dog by taking it everywhere while raising a middle finger to the rules? Yeah, that person has my respect. 

Here‚Äôs a good cold Beer raised in respect for you all from me in Down Under.
I try to post this in these sorts of threads, because there's always someone whose dog is getting old, and they're trying to make that hard decision
Hey, for all those of you who remember putting your pet down:

You're not 'putting them down'. You're helping them let go.

The problem is that your dog refuses to let go. You need them, there they are. Always. And not just when you need them, but when you're on the computer, or sitting on the couch. Your dog is there, because that's what they do.

Dogs don't know how to ask to be let go: It's not in a dog's nature to leave a man behind, so to speak. You gotta be the one to tell them it's okay, and you're not leaving.

You don't put them down. You pay them back for all the love they've given you.

Just do me a favour, if you're making that trip to the vet's: Hold your dog's paw when he's gotta go. Don't leave him in a room full of strangers because you're scared. Help him go.
American checking in. I've enjoyed all the posts on S√≠oda. I feel I never see a picture of your president without her. What a wonderful spirit. She was a beautiful pup. So very sorry for your loss.
I was about to get out of bed, fuck this, I'm going back to sleep.

Miserable news to hear.
Genuinely gutted to hear this.

We lost the cat last week, after 15 years. Just the dog and the kitten now, but it‚Äôs crazy how much you notice that they‚Äôre gone. 

RIP S√≠oda.
r/Ireland to 2020: and now, you have officially carried it too far, Buddy
Damn you 2020 you bitch
It's wine for breakfast then.
A sad day for the parish indeed
Never met this dog, not even Irish, crying right now
\*cry\*
Aw no. My mam met the dogs a few years ago at the presidents garden party. She said the dogs were so wonderful. üòî
That is a national tragedy. And I am not even joking.
It‚Äôs so sad. Poor Michael D.
I have exactly zero link or connection to Ireland, and I'm still sad üòû
RIP doggo :( 

Along with Br√≥d, they have done so much for us. 

National day of mourning, farewell S√≠oda.
Oh Fuck, I'm so sorry guys! Been a cunt of a year. Sending condolences from Down Under.
As a Welsh speaker, I appreciate that spelling --> pronounciation isn't always a direct mapping with English.  How would i pronounce it?

Edit - the dog's name, not "dog" ;-)
The straw that broke the tear ducts‚Äô back.
This should be world news our greatest commiserations from Australia
First RBG and now poor S√≠oda. Today is a dark day.
That's awful. Losing a dog is akin to losing a loved one. Thoughts with President Higgins.
Ah poor S√≠oda, and poor Br√≥d and Miggeldy. The best doggo ‚ù§Ô∏è
Deepest condolences from the US. I‚Äôm a huge admirer of President Higgins and in particular his relationship with his dogs. So sad to say goodbye to lovely S√≠oda.
I'm italian.

I didn't know anything about this dog. Seems like she had a good story to tell.

Was she really that popular with the Irish audience?
I cant actually handle any more bad news
‚ÄúWas I a good dog?‚Äù
As an American who just woke up, :( RIP you beautiful spirit, gorgeous Burmese with a hell of a fun story to tell her pals in dog heaven now. Safe travels across the rainbow bridge üíô
Ar dheist D√© go raibh a anam d√≠lis
National day of mourning.
The virus i can deal with but THIS
This is awful news. Give him a statue
Humans‚Äô best friend -  RIP Sioda.  Love on RGB for me!
Love you Sioda, love you Ireland
Here I am in California - acrid smoke in the air, RBG just died, it's 2:30am and I still have an hour or two of work left to do because we have a release coming up, there was just a 4.something earthquake, and now this. What a day.
I hope RBG adopts S√≠oda in heaven and they can live a peaceful after life together as one of the best women/doggies to grace the world. RIP
Absolute national tragedy, they should cover this on the news
[deleted]
Hope Br√≥d is handling everything okay.
:(
ahh shiet
Fuck this whole day
Damn this year to hell.
My condolences.
This is, without exaggeration, the worst day of my life
2020 just never lets up. Gut punch after gut punch.
Australian here.  I had no idea what the Irish president looked like, but he looks exactly the way I imagined he would.  I bet I'm not the first one to say it though.
From the world‚Äôs deepest heart we are sorry for your loss
Aww.. that‚Äôs heartbraking! They made me happy seeing them together everywhere ‚ù§Ô∏èüíî
Ahhh worst feeling in the world... üòî
F
This is the last straw, 2020. Too far. Too far by half.
You‚Äôve taken it too far 2020, Too damn far.
Could this year get any worse üò≠
I‚Äôm not Irish but you get my condolences sir.
Not Irish but I'm fucking heartbroken.
Love to y‚Äôall from the USA üåà
Took absolute tragedy for us to reach the top of /r/all

My friend got a pic with those dogs last year. Lucky bastard.
2020 just keeps getting worse!!!!!!
National day of mourning is in order
Is this what it feels like for the brits when the queen dies?
There is no greater bond than that of an Irishman and his dog. May she rest in peace
I'm not even Irish but I upvoted you all because anyone could tell that was a good pup and he did his job well.
Rule of 3 , Ginsburg, Sioda... who's next?
RIP, good girl. Thinking of you in the US. <3
Fuck it that‚Äôs depressing
Fuck 2020 to bollocks. WW3 and bushfires I could take but this is over the line.
What a shit year. RIP S√≠oda.
RBG now this! Why did I even wake up today...
Ah no! This is sad.
Oh no :-( RIP S√≠oda.
He loved his dog
GOD NO MAKE IT STOP
Damn this hurts me from across the Atlantic...
rip üò¢
NOOO GOD FECKING DAMM YA 2020
*Scrolls feed for 2.76 seconds*

‚ÄúAlright, that‚Äôs enough of Reddit for this year.‚Äù
How old did she get? Most bennies just get to be like 6 years old (very unhealthy breed) 
I love these dogs they're my favorite breed, they are funny, gentle, derpy, sweet, cuddle crazy,. Just wish people would breed them to be healthier :(
My day is ruined. I bet Higgins is devastated. I lost my dog this year too.
Do we have a national day for dogs? Cause we should.
For a second I thought it was a figurative and it meant a human.
So wh- oh shit, you mean a president and dog we care about
Another sad news... When is 2020 going to end..
I an so very very sorry for your loss üíîüíî
More evidence that 2020 is a garbage year
I am dead inside now officially
An Oireachtas emergency session has been summoned to designate an interim Good Dog, until new elections.
2020 has officially gone too far now.
First RBG, now this... 2020 just takes what it wants.
Sioda and Ruth Bader Ginsburg are chilling in heaven. You know Ruth has a pocket full of treats and her signature dissent collar.
Some people on reddit just take shit too far with awards. There‚Äôs 7 EXCITED AWARDS ON THIS POST. WHAT THE FUCK.
As an American, if you presented me a picture of that man I wouldn‚Äôt know who he is. A picture of him with the dog, though? Oh! That‚Äôs the President of Ireland!

My condolences to your President.
Fuck, RGB and now Sioda?

Not like this.... not like this....
How's its name pronounced
Ah no, lovely dog
Sioda. Thank you for making us smile.  üíö
Really? I see nothing anywhere online
This is the worst news ever, fuck this year!
National Day of mourning.. flags at half mast
This year has gone too far
Awww no. ‚òπÔ∏èRIP‚ù§Ô∏èüê∂
Rest in peace, S√≠oda. :'(
Well fuck, that's very sad. What a shitty day this is turning out to be all around... :(
Oh no! It is literally the worst year ever.
That's the second bout of crying at my desk today in work üôÉ
Noo
Rip
Rip Sioda
NOOOOOO!
RIP
F o7
This is incredibly sad! Sioda looked young and healthy.
My good boy was also taken from us this year. 
Fuck 2020, indeed.  :(
Ok this year has gone too far. FUCK YOU 2020
Great. The Notorious RBG and now this. 2020 just won‚Äôt stop.
Poor doggie - losing a pet is the same as losing a family member - sometimes it‚Äôs very hard (but not always)
Ah lads.
the worst part of 2020
First, RBG.

Now this.

Only one logical conclusion, a god is real and he/she/it hates us.
For a moment I thought "Sioda" was some strange nickname for Lindsay Graham.
RIP Doggy. :/
Awh that's so sad!
Was it this dog in the photo? He has 2.
Such a good boy.
Has Donald Trump ever owned and cared for a pet?
Wow big surprise on the worst year ever
Poor baby
Fuck this
This is weird. My Bernese mountain dog that was 11 years old was put down yesterday.

The greatest dog breed I have ever had
Ugh.. what a way to start this saturday. RIP.
He needs a day or two of doing nothing. Poor man.
wholesome doggo rip üòî
That sucks.
üòîüíî
The whole world loved that dog.
RIP doggie
how do you pronounce that?
Dogs will rule the world once we selfextinct.
The nation will go John Wick on whoever downvotes this
yesterday, Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies.

and now wake up to this...........

WTF 2020
Had a dog like that when i was a kid. His name was Elvis
Rest in peace, good doggy
I have 2 berneses the just hap 7 pups and I hope they dont die
Rip sioda

How do you pronounce the name?
‚ÄùWhen I walked in this morning, and saw the flag was at half mast, I thought alright another bureaucrat ate it.

But then I found out it was S√≠oda. Half mast is too high. Show some damn respect.‚Äù
State funeral
I am irrationally sad over this
Tis a dark day for Ireland.
 I loved that dog. Fucking sad bro.
God that's gotta suck. That dog was adorable and obviously spoiled rotten every day of its life.

I hope he'll get another when and if he's ready for it.

EDIT: OK, mind blown... he actually had two dogs;  Br√≥d and S√≠oda. I always thought it was just the one.
How do you pronounce her name please?
Ar dheis D√© go raibh a anam d√≠lis
NOOOOOOOOO!!
RIP big boyy
All flags must be at half mast
I never met the dog, I dont even know how to pronounce his name, but the fact that there's one less Good Boi in the world makes me sad.
What a beautiful dog.
2020 HAS GONE TOO FUCKIN FAR
Can someone from Ireland give a pronunciation of that name? I read it as ‚ÄúSee-OH-Da‚Äù but I‚Äôm guessing from every other Irish name starting with S I‚Äôve ever seen (I.e. Sean, Siobhan, Sinead, Saoirse) that it‚Äôs probably not that simple.
RIP - what  a beautiful dog.
Ah Jaysus
Solidarity from Scotland.
I hope Brod doesnt get too lonely without his little pal. So sad to hear of a dog passing, but especially such a cutie pie.

Aw, no. That's just too sad.
Oh noooooo :(
[deleted]
Oh no! I'm just a thick-headed American, but even I knew how much that dog meant to your president. My condolences.
Before I saw the sub, I could have sworn that was Bernie.
Real talk..is he a good president? He seems like he would be and I base this on knowing very little. Then again compared to what we have (Trump) everyone seems better.
Noooooooo

Oh no my condolences to him...
Sad face.
Fuck you, 2020!
Man....fuck 2020
So sad.  I really enjoyed seeing pics of her by his side while he was working.  

I'd like to think she's gone to join RBG in heaven and be her companion now.  Both of them champions and heroes.
Yeah, fuck 2020.
The Reaper shows no restraint this year -_-
Man I feel awful for y‚Äôall‚Äôs president.   They seemed inseparable.  Rest In Peace goodest of boiz
First Ruth Bader Ginsberg, and now s√≠oda I don‚Äôt see how this day can get any worse.
I need 2020 to be over plz n thx
American here, sorry, I kneejerk downvoted this post forgetting I was sorting by "Everywhere". My apologies to Ireland and condolences to your President's Family, as I assume they have some sort of dignity. cheers?
F
I don't know what 2020 is trying to prove, but someone needs to tell ut nobody likes it, and it should go home.
I can handle Corona, the Cali fires, protests and riots... BUT SIODA??? WHAT'S NEXT 2020? WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY DO IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS OF THE YEAR?
üò≠
Rip Sioda and to the president my thoughts and wishes
Such a wonderful, loyal dog as well, may she rest in peace.
Let's have a cup of tea and let this all blow over

Was IM talking to a British bloke at work about issues we're having on the project. He said, "Clowns to the right of me, jokers to the left!"

I said, "hey! That's how the Irish feel!"

He refused to talk to me the rest of the day.
Don‚Äôt worry, America is fine. We have that one CNN Irish reporter in Washington who will solve everything
As a Swede I wouldn‚Äôt be completely opposed to the rise of the Irish empire
Guys, we really need your help. Send over another million Irishmen.
For real tho, what about sites other than Amazon. I have stuff on order from Scan.co.uk (computer stuff) that hasn't come yet. I ordered in December and paid UK VAT. But now apparently I'm liable for Irish VAT when it comes? And have to get the UK VAT back somehow? Idk. Probably better off cancelling it but I really want this stuff.
As someone who works in an Amazon FC, nothing will ever stop the endless deafening hum of those conveyor belts, unless I get bored and press one of these big red buttons...
[deleted]
As a Brit, I'm glad Ireland is doing better than the UK. You all deserve it after the shite we put you through
[deleted]
Class shitpost. Kudos
Morning news, check covid rates misery.... then America did WHAT ? Britian NOOO you can't !
How is America the skinny one?
*laughs nervously in Canadian*
Be grand like.
Been saying for years, it shall be highlarious if Brexit causes Scottish independence and the reunification of Ireland.
This American thanks you for the laugh.  Stay awesome, Ireland.
Deliveries? They've removed 90% of the content from Prime Video for viewing in Ireland. Im raging. Debating now whether or not keeping prime is worth it at all
Life would be pretty good right now if my personal life wasn't such a mess.
What is going on with amazon?.. Nothing seems to be working like it did before. I cant get video content. Should i just cancel?
Glad to see the Europeans getting a kick out of this
We‚Äôre literally not allowed to leave our house because they think the hospital system might collapse...
We are so embarrassed in America.  Just so the world knows,  in Georgia we just elected our first Black Senator and our First Jewish Senator.  Don‚Äôt judge us by what you see happening at the Capitol.
America,  a great bunch of la....oh.
You are all the best people in the world!!
Oh, go on, Father.
We had a whole debate on the Mexican side of twitter on whether to hit buy now on our international listings or wait a bit more until the USD/MXN change rates to drop a bit more.
Britain ending is a natural process. Its been happening since 1920 Ireland and accelerated in 2014.
I ordered three books on the 20th of December and they were due to arrive first on the the 27th, then the 29th, then the 5th and finally the 9th. I was refunded for them yesterday because they were sent back to where they were originally shipped from lol.
As an American I laughed too hard at this !  üòÇü§£
Us googling who the heck in donnie..
Sad but true.
As a Brazilian, I just wanna see the world burn.
Can I immigrate pls? :(
I'd say its mostly London falling apart. Shits ok where I live, still working n such
Canadian's pray their government keeps the border closed
How does UK fall apart? What have I missed?
What‚Äôs that original meme?  Can somebody link a brotha up?
Royal mail legit "lost" my package a few days before Christmas. It was a Christmas present. I fucking hate when mail is either stolen by opportunistic chancers or delayed because politicians are playing football with life changing policy.
Hmmm, maybe moving to Ireland is in the stars now :)
Stayed at home the entire day

What a blessing
As someone who is in the UK please steal the six counties back. I just want out of this hell hole.
Hate begets hate. Remember to be civil.
I hear Ireland is one of the happiest place to live in the world.. Always wanted to live there, my ancestors were from there. Maybe when I'm older and retired I'll find my way back to those green and purple hills.....
Please annex us 

Sincerely, Scotland
Canada is the same as Ireland then, at least for now.

Fuck Amazon, stop fucking supporting that trash
American here, do you guys mind if i come over and sleep on your sofa for a few weeks? I promise not to drink all your beer, and you can explain hurling to me. I've even pitch in and buy you a bunch of Club Rock Shandy.
What's happening in the UK?

I miss you Ireland! Let me come back, my country is nuts!
Can I please move to Ireland? It's all I've wanted since I was 15.
Do ya'll welcome American refugees? Asking for my family.
How would an American go about getting citizenship in Ireland?  Asking for a friend.
What's going on with Britain? As an American, I truly have no idea
Both here in the UK, and the US, we elected clowns, so here comes the circus.

(I say "we": it would take for all the other candidates to pledge they will kill puppies and kittens with hammers before I even consider voting Tory.)
US expat living in Galway here. Happy to be on the 'Emerald Isle' right now, cold weather and all.
First time I saw your sub on r/all, still waiting for my 3080...
From a Scottish person, sit tight Ireland, we'll call when we need your backup
American here, can I move in with you for awhile?
Fuck Amazon! Pls don‚Äôt support them
Boycott Amazon.
Feels fine here in Blighty...
As an American, how is Britan falling apart
Y‚Äôall taking expats?
Only for lockdown and we could ‚Äúgo down the Winchester, have a nice cold pint and wait for all this to blow over‚Äù.
Maybe it helps if you give them the same deal as Apple
Be safe all.  
The States are falling apart.
Without sounding really stupid, what‚Äôs happening in Britain thats making us ‚Äòfall apart‚Äô? That seems like an enormous overstatement? 

I mean we are getting on our feet a bit because we just left the EU, in lockdown and getting on with vaccines, but falling apart... am I missing something?
Ireland does not have Amazon...
They're sowing the seeds of discontent in Ireland as well. Give it a couple decades. You'll see what we were up against
As if Ireland can help.
[deleted]
What‚Äôs going on in Britain?
Just remember to shop local as much as you can while still being safe! If you find a product on amazon you like, there is a high chance the company who makes it can also deliver at the same if not better price! Just takes a few extra clicks!

Also if you can find a locally crafted item that will serve the same purpose it's always good to put money back into your community! Better than give it to a large corporation who has shady tax practices!
Ireland dusting off the Armalites and rebel songs while refreshing their memory on guerrilla tactics... with a pint of Guinness
I really wouldn‚Äôt say Britain is falling apart but ok
What's going on in Britain?
More like looking for books on how to speak Russian.
Guys I'm sorry my great grandfather left Ireland to come to the US, can I come back please? I'll be good I promise
I live in America but I guess I‚Äôm Irish.
Why yall acting like this is the end of America? If I hadn't got on the political subreddits I follow, I would have never known what happened except that my husband casually told me when it started. I took a nap and made breakfast for dinner and got my package from Amazon.
Meanwhile, in L'manberg....
Amazon delivery? Didn't know they sell Norther Ireland on there.
God I wish I wasn‚Äôt a middle class American, my wife and I want to move to Ireland so bad, I looked up how to on google...yeah that ain‚Äôt happening. Anyone wanna adopt a 37 year old History Major?
Not falling apart, it's not that bad here and definitely exaggerated in the news.
Italy great bunch of lads.

One of the most stressful games I‚Äôve ever watched.
You're welcome my Irish friends. Can't wait for my Erasmus to Dublin now.
Let's hope bonfires get rained on tomorrow and it'll the best week ever
As a fellow Italian fan, thank you for the support guys, i love you all, made up my mind my next trip will be Ireland!
The deafening silence after they lost outside my London apartment was absolute bliss.. :) 2 hours of "it's cammming home" and beeping horns after the semis. Thank you Italy x
The absolute relief

Hay England‚Ä¶.. Sorry just got a call from football. They said they aren‚Äôt coming home tonight.
To be fair England shouldn‚Äôt have played a 19 year old on the final penalty the entire pressure of people watching at home and at the stadium was probably too much for him
High sense of relief. On the negative side, you just know that Rashford, Sancho, and Saka are going to be racially abused on social media tonight, I‚Äôd bet everything I have on it happening. It‚Äôs disgusting, unacceptable, and ultimately childish, but that‚Äôs the world we live in for ye.
Chiellini was a absolute beast
As a fellow Italian who spent two (wonderful) years in Leitrim (2019-2020), I just want to say I love ye lads and lasses.
[deleted]
The pure embarrassment of  the English supporter who decided it would be a good idea to watch the match at an Italian bar. Almost cringed out of existence when he clapped for the royals on screen.  

(Edit, I didn't make it clear that I witnessed this in person)
Us Danes can finally be at peace!
We WILL hear the end of it!
They didn‚Äôt buckle at all even when the English fans were raining boos on the Italian penalty takers. Solid performance
They scored some gabagoals
I‚Äôm just so happy for Declan Rice üòä
There's programs that dim your screen at night, and diminish blue light to almost nothing. You don't notice it at all until you need to tell what color something is. Recently I saw an image with a flag, and had to disable to filter to tell - *is that Italy, or Ireland?*

It was Romania.
I can't wait to tell this story to my grandsons and I'm only in my 30s

As a united fan it was hard to turn off the loyalties to Rashford and Sancho.. but wait ‚Äòtill you see the racist abuse the 3 penalties missers get from a section of the England fans
Christ. Thank fuck for that
Thank Christ, England fans and commentators would have been unbearable
The worst part is, knowing Rashford, Saka and Sancho are definitely going to be getting a LOT of racial abuse.
You love to see it.

You know, maybe it's not that relevant, but some years ago I had the chance to move abroad, and in the end the choice was in between England and Ireland. In no more than two seconds I went like: "feck those pretentious pricks, I'm moving to Cork". And I hadn't even the slightest idea where Cork was. Since then, every time I feel sad I end a sentence with "like", and I find my smile again. Like. üáÆüá™

Thank fuck, now let's just pray for torrential rain tomorrow! ‚òî
That left post took a beating tonight.
Can you imagine the absolutely arrogance had England won the euros in the year of Brexit!? So glad it ended like that, Forza Italia!!!!
Thank you pastabros üáÆüáπ
Feel a bit sorry for England - penalties is a terrible way to go out. But that fella Donnarumma is a monster!
You know what, Schillaci was alright.
Those poor poor English wives
The English fan base showing their class again tonight. They reached their first final  in 55 years and as soon as their team lost they all fucked off out of there. Didn't even stick around to see their team get their medals, or god forbid, congratulate the winners. The stadium was almost empty apart from the Italian fans
Carbonara this week.
This is especially sweet living in England. The last 3 weeks have been unbearable, now finally peace is restored
Most of the English players barely had the medal on before immediately whipping it off. Is that normal for the losing team to do? Not a football fan so don‚Äôt know what the norm is, maybe it‚Äôs always done, but it seemed like kind of a sore loser move‚Ä¶
With all their booing, get fucked you losers. Take Conor McGregor with you.
Italy was superior the whole time. More possession, more passes, better uniforms, better fans. Congratulations to Italy.
Thank fuck they won
We did it for you guys too,much love  from Italy!
As much as I wanted Italy to win, I felt bad for them going out that way. Then they all took off the silver medals and that just seemed like a bit of a d\*ck move...
Funniest part of the match was the camera man trying to find a decent looking female English fan over the 90minites, and when he did, he kept returning to her.

The rest were Jeremy Kyle guests.
I‚Äôm arguing with an English guy in another thread. Took two jokes for him to call Ireland ‚Äúan irrelevant tax haven‚Äù

If they‚Äôre pissing off the English this much they‚Äôre truly a great bunch of lads.
Delighted for Chiellini and Bonucci especially - two great players - to cap off their careers, but can't help feeling sorry for the English players.

You know that they're going to get so much over-the-top, toxic abuse from the media and public over this.
Forza Italia!!
Shoulda used more lasers I guess.
Keep crying Declan
The better team won. It was so embarrassingly obvious from straight after England scored that Italy were going to boss it. If anything, Italy should have won that comfortably in regulation. Possession stats were 66/34 to Italy. Sometimes penalties do deliver a just outcome.
This will now be the top post and deservedly so.
I brought out the mozzarella for the occasion even.
I‚Äôm half Irish and half Italian
Thank you irish brothers
The racist abuse by English fans of their own players is an absolute disgrace.
Gareth Southgate, some lad. 
Absolutely sabotaged that game and you‚Äôd have to love him for it
Any Irish buddy here, can anyone save the Italians in London please? They are persecuted right now
It‚Äôs not going home it‚Äôs going to RomeüòÇüòÇ
Definitely not regretting staying up when I‚Äôm up at 5am for work in the morning.
No worry guys,we made football come homeüáÆüáπ
Happy for Italy, especially given everything they‚Äôve been through during COVID times & the people they‚Äôve lost.
Love how this brings the countries together.
It definitely came Rome.
I love Italians so much
Either way London is gonna burn tonight lol
That was stressful man hahahahahah worth all the screaming hahahaha
The day I woke up and found out who won via r/Ireland before anything else. Slainte.
I switched over to BBC after the game onky to see Gary Leineker accusing Bonucci and Chiellini of being on steroids.

Ooooh yeah, here come the British press sour grapes porn! üëå

That said, got to feel for the three that missed. Watch Rashford get dragged through the mud by their right wing tabloids after shaming the government into feedibg their poorest children.
3/4s of Wembley looking like they've cleared the stands.
No Grace for your opposition.  No Heart for your own team.
Ultimate Losers.
Hats off to the English team. They played it so good the whole match. Nice that Italy won.
Gonna have a bowl of bolognese for breakfast to celebrate
Literally beaten at their own game
Well. Someone was going to post this. FORZA ITALIA!
Serves the English right for fucking over the Danes
You're welcome.
I've never loved the Italians so much in my life, absolute legends
Fucking delighted Italy won.
That fucking "It's coming home" meme needs to die. I do not watch TV or use social media so hasn't realised how widespread it was. 

I hope English fans can support the team and not turn on them in an instant, but looks like it's already happening. 

Fuck those English fans who are racist to the team that gave us our best result in a long time.  England deserves better fans!
I‚Äôm half Irish and half Italian so this win is just *chefs kiss*
Thank god, if England won we never hear the end of it! That will shut them up for a while üòÇüòÇ
Ciao
As a colourblind person I can also confirm the Irish are lovely also
It's funny I don't take as much pleasure in them losing as I would have taken displeasure in them winning.
The nation of my grandpa. FORZA ITALIA!!!!!!
As an Englishman, I'll continue to cheer for Ireland when they play whomever.

:Thumbup:
As an American, I must say before this competition I never knew that England was so hated AND that it was so deserved. This has been very enlightening, thank you.
Internet must have gone down in England
Footballs coming Rome.
I've been waiting for this exact post
Perfect subs from Southgate.
Some of English fan behaviour following the match is really upsetting to see all over a game, delighted Italy have won for this reason. They've had a great year after the tough times with covid, first a Eurovision win and now this. 

Che grande!
YHEEEE HAWWWWWWWWW
Honestly they way England took those PKs was so arrogant and I genuinely think that‚Äôs what lost it for them. They stutter stepped and faked and did everything but kick the damn ball properly into the net. Like, just fucking kick the ball and stop dicking around.
Aye, allies.
GO ON ITALY GO ON
not a bad flag eh
Go on Rome , British soldiers , Go on Rome!

Have you got no fookin Romes of yer own
no idea what's happening but Yay!!! Winners!!
I swear to god Italy's flag is just Irelands's flag but with increased saturation
Ty flag neighbours

This is hilarious.
Up the Italians!
Cheers friends!
From the US, I was in a British pub in California surrounded by English fans and was the only one saying Italy will win with a $50 bet. Thanks Italy, great lads!
It's coming home

Italy: Hold my spicy meat-a-ball
One of my poor unfortune future offspring is getting Bonucci in their name somewhere!
You just have to appreciate Italy's win, their were overwhelmed by English fans booing them literally everytime they had the ball, the English scored in the first two minutes, if it was any other team I think they would have lost but Italy showed great heart and composure.
Feel bad for the players. Tried their best, but fuck the fans. All of then can go home and shut their mouths. The lasers, the domestic abuse allegations, racism and the absolute inability to shut the fuck up were the key features of the English fans through the entire thing.
normally i wouldnt go in for "political football", or even football for that matter, but after how the english fans acted during the game with denmark, it seems poetic that England later lost on penalties
This happens when you put pineapples on pizza
I‚Äôm drunk off the fact that England lost!
Great post
Red is basically orange anyway.
We weren't saying that 30 years ago when Schillaci knocked Ireland out of the quarter finals! But today, yes, great bunch of lads.

They saved us having to put up with "It's Coooming Home" for the next 4 years.
I'm going to say something controversial, I felt sorry for the English team ..... right until they took their medals off, then they became cheap. How far England has fallen.

Any good site i can buy an italy jersey?
Is there anything to be said for another pizza?
You lads need to come down to italy and if you see our pubs, you will not be disappointed. The Guinness flows like rivers.

I am glad that toxic assholes didn't win. It is just a game why would you fight like it is a war?
Regardless of anything I‚Äôm just shocked how nobody is talking about how Chiellini grabbed 19 year old Saka‚Äôs shirt and dragged him down when he was making an amazing run with no one left, nobody likes a dirty player
Fuck the English
I guess it is HOME ALONE tonight! Christams is early this year!:)
Always welcome in Portlaoise from here on out. The strength of ten horses be with them
Has anyone checked on Simon Coveney?
Yes boi! Gon on Italy!!
Great group of fellas.
Not gonna lie, was nervous there for a bit.
We got the same flag, fuck whoever says it's different. Orange is just a lighter red
My poor heart, I thought I‚Äôm going to pass out during the penalties. Viva l‚ÄôItalia! üáÆüáπ what a match.

I just hope Rashford and Saka will be shielded from all the backlash and racism coming from ‚Äúfans‚Äù and the media. They‚Äôre only kiddos, especially Saka. It can get nasty.
Thank you!

My heart sunk today morning when I saw the headlines. It's my 1 year in Dublin. And I have no words to tell you but thank you. I just hope my family is okay it's all I want really üá∫üá¶
I'm Russian, my half brother is Ukrainian. I'm in Dublin, he's in Kiev. I tried to stay out of politics, but this morning he was woken up by bombs near Kiev. I am going to regret not speaking up against Russian encroachment for years to come.
[At least include the link to the UN Ambassador saying as much](https://youtu.be/H5fcis5LfJ0?t=5532)
We cannot be held hostage by Russian gas and oil imports in Europe. If this means temporary pain while we invest copious amounts of money into sustainable energy sources for energy security, I will suffer the pain.

This shit has got to end.
How can you help? You can talk about it, you can learn about it. I know a lot of people think that changing background or profile pic is stupid but it creates visibility. I know it is not your pain and not your problem but it's a war happening in Europe and we're all part of Europe.
After waking up at 5am and seeing all the stuff that's happening I really wish everyone in Ukraine who can see this makes it out , I'm not a religious person in the slightest but I will pray for all of ye lads
My wife is Russian. She reading the news and crying.

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

Are we going to let people fleeing the conflict in and be kind to them when they get here?
Laptop background set to Ukrainian flag.
Fuck Putin and any fellow Irish person who supports him. Ya dense cunts. 

Hope Ukraine all the best, they don‚Äôt deserve this shite. Do what you can to help them. Lots of information in /r/ukraine
Considering how much effort Russia has put in to try and blame the West for it's aggression and how many Putinbots are pushing their false narrative online, this is one of the few times I can see virtually showing your solidarity being valid. 

It doesn't help Ukraine or stop Russian aggression but it least it shows that most people here aren't being taken in by the Kremlin's lies.
Have we turned into Facebook or something?
It's finally time to weaponise the Tipp jersey as a protest garment.
You know there is a Russian embassy in Ireland. It would be far more effective to protest outside there, rather than starting a virtue signalling thread on reddit. But you wont get any karma for it.  


Embassy of Russia  
Address: 186 Orwell Rd, Rathmines Great, Dublin, Ireland
Ukrainians, great bunch of lads
Meanwhile our cunt of a president (Bolsonaro) shows solidarity to Putin.
Jaysus. Fair amount of dickheads here.
The sheer amount of morons on Twitter who are taking Russias side in this conflict is fucking daft
‚Ä¶ so expel all Russian diplomats and close embassy.
Remind me again why Russia is attacking Ukraine.
Write to your local td and ask that Ireland do as much as possible to help. We're a small country but when it comes to our humanity I couldn't be more confident in our ability to do what is right.
fuck putin. all my homies hate putin
As a Russian I just want to say that Russia ‚â† putin. Our people don‚Äôt want war, and we‚Äôd much rather prefer Ukraine to be left alone. Nevertheless, sometimes I just feel ashamed of my heritage‚Ä¶
How about standing on the front line with Ukrainians
Sure look, while invasions are a thing, we ***could*** have a crack at England. They‚Äôd never see it coming
Despite what some people are saying about useless internet posts here, I'm proud Irish people are expressing their disgust for Putin and support of Ukraine online, even if it contributes little to nothing. It's important to show where you stand and express it peacefully and the internet is the only way most will or can express that. The red paint thrown on the Russian embassy today, bravo. Peaceful expression of distaste for what is happening. Keep that coming.
Absolutely disgusting to see the likes of Richard Boyd-Barrett, Mick Wallace, Claire Daly, various Sinn Fein TDs etc all trotting out the "west are the real war-mongers" line and sucking up to Russia.

People before Profit or Putin before People. The Irish Trotskyists still have a serious hard on for their ideological motherland.
As usual, the putin bots and "ah lads, we can't do fuckin' anything like" types are out in full force.

Fuck you, you useless cunts.

Ireland should stand in solidarity here by default, because of its past of being occupied and bullied by a larger imperialist country.

Just a secondary note, all the neutrality comments: are you guys neutral to international law too? Would explain some of the crime posts we keep seeing here on the sub. I'll make sure to make a note anytime I see bullying to not intervene... I'm a neutral now.

I'd love to give lil vladdy a good kick up the hole! What a disgusting pos he is.
Up Ukraine!!
As a country that suffered from strong imperialist aggression, the Irish government must immediately expel the Russian Ambassador and break diplomatic, commercial, and cultural links with the Russian Federation. Ireland may be small, but our voice and standing in world relationships is larger. We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past and let Ukraine be swallowed the way Czechoslovakia was in 1938!
Any human stands with Ukraine.  


The rest, the garbage of humanity don't.
This isn't standing. This is sitting at home memeing. If you want to help, donate and protest our gutless refusal to save human lives

A Russian taxi driver told me last night that Russia invading Ukraine is like if Ireland invaded Northern Ireland. Like it‚Äôs technically an invasion but lots of people see it as a reunification. Was he talking shite?

We need to throw the Russian ambassador out, and so should the rest of Europe.

Cool, also utterly useless unless Ireland is one of the countries that imposes the most strict sanctions available.
So long as I can stay here in safe Ireland I stand with them in a symbolic way.
No one stands with Ukraine actually. No one will back them up. No real sanctions have been set up against Russia, because of the usual reason, greed.

Doesn't benefit our politicians, or any ones except Ukrainian.

Solidarity means fuck all in times of war. You can't cancel the Russian army, or shame them into retreat. It's time to fight, and I'm sure as shit not going over to Donbas. Ireland is neutral.
Ireland should expel the Russian ambassador. We don't need any diplomatic relations with terrorist nations

Ah for fuck sake.
Simon Coveney announced today that Ireland would not be neutral on this matter. It‚Äôs not his place to say that and it‚Äôs completely unconstitutional. I believe our neutrality should be protected at all costs.
Don't forget the UK's involvement in this too. Torys boys are in bed with Vlad
Please explain to me like I'm 5. What does this mean, like how are you gonna help the situation from behind your screen? I'm sure if we all change our profile pictures to the Ukrainian flag and send prayers the whole thing will go away.

Speak for yourself.
Wow that's so helpful, so when does this subreddit start sending troops, supplies or something real to help?
I get the sentiment but they need actual physical support right now. Not a picture of their flag on the subreddit.
I always wonder when people say something like this.   How are you with Ukraine? You there helping, you there fighting?  Or you just praying Russia stops and goes home?
Remember a few months ago when everyone did this with Palestine and nothing changed? Keep pretending you can make a difference with one-off forum posts, it's what Reddit does best.

It's such an insult to everyone that lost their lives.

And those that will do.

I've lost my job and i've been caring for my 80 year old parents since this thing kicked off in March. They haven't been outside the house in 5 months, driving me bat shit crazy. Now I have to put up with a possible 2nd and 3rd wave from people coming in from the US. I'm mad as hell. Eamon Ryan needs a kick up the arse. They tried this two-week quarantine bollocks in Melbourne and look how that turned out.
[Oh boy.](https://i.imgur.com/bQyd3gc.png) 

This won't be taken down, folks. A fair call for some fair rules regarding the safety of our people is not hate speech, spam, or misinformation.
Enjoy the non-lockdown while it lasts fellows, we are busy getting COVID right back.  


I mean this is how we got it in the first place. No checks in airports. This is almost certainly how we are going to get it again. I don't understand it. Perhaps the government thinks that it would look bad doing so, and it has taken flack about direct provision (which is very, very loosely connected with the idea of screening incoming passengers) so perhaps they think that the public would be opposed to quarantining passengers coming from America? Or perhaps they have just given up on stopping a second wave?
if you feel this way, start emailing The Sun or Joe.ie or whatever and tweet it.  Reddit is an echo chamber and no one really picks it up.   the click bait sites pick up trends on twitter.  as mental as it is, that's how issues get attention...we need #noamericantravel trending or something like it for it to be noticed.  our powers that be have shown they will only react to that ki d of press...
I‚Äôm an American living in Ireland. Planned to go see family before Covid. The minute it kicked off I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be seeing them this year. 

My heart is broken because I desperately want to see my family. But, I know leaving would maybe expose them (what if I‚Äôm asymptomatic?) or me going there and bringing it back to Ireland after a few weeks. 

I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt risk that, even though I have no guarantee on seeing my family again. It‚Äôs reckless and selfish. 

Anyone coming from America to Ireland for a fun trip...genuinely and from the deepest part of my heart; **fuck you**. You know you shouldn‚Äôt be travelling here. You know full well America, even in some of the least ‚Äòhit‚Äô states, don‚Äôt have this anywhere near ‚Äòcontrolled‚Äô. 

You shouldn‚Äôt be welcomed here with open arms. Just as I shouldn‚Äôt be welcomed back to my adopted new country if I choose to go to and from America without an emergency cause.
Brazilian here. Ban Brazil too

I‚Äôm expat living in Florida. Let me tell you.... you need to stop then traveling in. Mind blowing how these people are acting.
Another American voice saying you're absolutely right. I live in NJ, a state hit really hard early on. News reports lumped us in with NY, so the awesome response by our governor was lost amid the noise. He's taken alot of shit for locking down for a long time and a slow data-driven reopening, but our curve is bent and we're one of 3 states in the green zone, which is remarkable since we're the most densely populated of the 50. 

We currently have a soft 14 day quarantine from a bunch of states that have approached the virus like selfish morons. I wish it was mandatory but I don't know how they would enforce it. We don't want any of those dumb fuckers here any more than you do. Stay strong, stay safe. 

Love, NJ. We're mean, but at least we aren't stupid.
What is the point of a lockdown if the borders are open? You are just pissing in the wind, killing your economy and still killing the vulnerable population. Why is this being accepted?

This would be why NZ has 21 deaths from Covid and Ireland has more deaths than NZ had cases.
One dumb texan was interviewed on newstalk yesterday and insisted the whole thing was blown out of proportions. That cunt is free to walk around as he sees fit.
[deleted]
As someone who works in the medical sector this really has pissed me off as its a massive fuck you to all of the front-line workers & those who lost their jobs.
Who sanctioned this? How dare they do this to us after months of sacrifice! Schools will not be back in September now and we will have to endure lockdown in Winter for what- some grubby tourist dollars? So much for green zones. Ban tourism from all covid hotspots!!!
You know, how would the world be reacting if the Chinese handled this pandemic the same as Americans?  

There would be fucking uproar. Calls for nuclear bombing. Rampant Chinese racism, the works.

Hi, American here. Please ban us. There's just too many idiots trying to "vacation". Some of us are trying to sort this out (in Atlanta, where I'm living, they're trying to enforce some basic precautions) but the country at large is still a mess. Again. Also it'd be nice for Trump to feel the effects of a proper travel ban. That's all, idiot American out.
Another American here. Yup, ban us please. We have no control over our citizens, and there's a large majority who think COVID is fake and masks are, somehow, taking away their freedom.
Just wanted to chime in as an American, I agree America should be banned from traveling until things greatly improve.  My wife and I went to Ireland for our honeymoon and loved every moment of it (except for the one hotel that gave us two twin beds....we just pushed them together) I can tell you that many Americans are embarrassed of our government and the hillbillies who are making everything worse.  You want to close off travel from us to protect your  country then go for it.  Will people get pissed and feel "targeted"?  Yeah, but you don't want those people anyways.  Take care of yourselves
Really the Americans? We just going to ignore the fact the Brits pose way more of a threat? And there's 1000 times more of them travelling here than Americans. Off the ferry every day, every week.
[deleted]
Jobs? How about an insult to those who lost their lives?!
I work in a very popular tourist attraction in Dublin. Americans arrived at the door to come in and were turned away when they said they only arrived in Ireland earlier today. It‚Äôs actually ridiculous that they‚Äôre allowed just come here for their holidays.
As an American, I agree
I'm an American and I absolutely love Ireland. I spent two weeks in your country by myself and traveled all around your gorgeous country in 2017. I cannot wait to return...once it is safe to do so. A ban or not, please know some of us Americans do what's right regardless. I could never forgive myself if I inadvertently caused harm to you and your great country by selfishly visiting during the midst of a pandemic. It pained me to cancel my Ireland trip this year. But I, along with many other responsible Americans, will return when it's safe. I'm not alone in my thinking. God speed to every one of us!
Americans need to be banned from the rest of the world for a few years 

Greatest country on earth? Good. Stay there.
American here, I'm lucky to live in Rhode Island. One of 2 states that are showing a decline and slowly returning to normalcy.  US travelers absolutely should NOT be allowed to travel to other countries. Hell, I don't even want people not from my state coming here!
Being from Texas and seeing the countless people at Walmart either not wearing mask once they go in or wearing it below their nose. Every other country should ban us from entry
I'm an American with loved ones in Ireland. Travel ban at this moment is honestly the smartest thing to do
‚ÄúUntil they sort their shit out‚Äù

And that is how the Ireland closed to Americans forever.
I‚Äôm an American who self-identifies as a plastic paddy. Been around the culture my entire life in my community, dad grew up an Irish dancer, always was playing the chieftains or the Dubliners and told me it was important to remember ‚Äúour‚Äù collective peoples history. That being said, I‚Äôve never been to Ireland. Grew up really poor and was never able to make it happen. Suddenly after university I have the definite means and could feasibly make a trip happen right now. 
But Jesus fucking Christ my actual country of birth is so fucking stupid when it comes to anything that we actually made this a political issue. I‚Äôd love to go to Ireland but I‚Äôm not going to risk transmitting anything and I don‚Äôt blame any country at all for not allowing us in. This is all unbelievably fucking frustrating.
If I meet a single person that travelled here from abroad during this entire fucking debacle, especially America, I will personally find where they're staying and I will shit in all their shoes.....
As an American, I completely agree with this. Put our whole country in time out ffs.
As an American... I'm sorry, I agree with you. We done fucked up.
In South Korea from landing you're required to fill out 4 different forms, get tested for Covid-19 and download an app where you log your temperature or other symptoms twice a day. You get assigned to an account manager who calls you regularly and tracks your location to see if you're isolating yourself correctly.
My cousin has traveled from the southern US to Kerry for a holiday. He probably wouldn't have come but business is slow so he is here on holiday. A-hole is posting on instragram going to Tesco and Aldi, touching produce to show how cheap they are for his followers. I have no respect for him now. 0 quarantine after traveling via the North.
All we are trying to say is, we still love ye, but now is just not a good time.
I'm one of those Americans who lurks here. You NEED to ban Americans from coming in. It's a silent nightmare in the US. I have been thinking about moving overseas for a while and Ireland was at the top of my list, but now I don't think I'll ever be able to leave... It really is scary here.
Agreed. Tis madness.
Adding my voice to the pile here as an American (and half-Irishman), do not let us in. We cannot be trusted.

I was in Dublin during St. Patrick's Day as I had to stopover there because I was fleeing back to America from Lebanon where I had been studying. Even though we were in the midst of a giant pandemic, all the pubs were closed, all the restaurants shut, there were STILL Americans out and about, trying to find places to drink and party. STILL.

Let us in when it's safe.
I‚Äôm an American and I can‚Äôt say I blame you guys at all. Too many inbreds over here aren‚Äôt taking it seriously and you shouldn‚Äôt have your health jeopardized because of our stupidity.
We should call for the total and complete shutdown of the entry of Americans until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.
Coronavirus isn‚Äôt real.  Every country in the world made the pandemic up to make Trump look bad so we won‚Äôt vote for him in November.  Didn‚Äôt you know that.  /s

One of my coworkers actually believes that, despite knowing someone who had corona.  And died from complications from being on a ventilator.  I guess it isn‚Äôt real because they died from the ventilator and not directly from the virus?
Anyone complained to their td?
Living in the USA rn and please please do this. The general population here is woefully misinformed and we will only spread the virus wherever we go.
It's especially worth noting that the kind of Americans that would still decide to travel anywhere outside our country are also exactly the kind you don't want. They won't wear masks. They won't social distance. They won't quarantine. Many of them won't even wash their damn hands regularly. You'd be completely insane to let us in at this point. It sucks to say it, and I'd love to see the world right now, but please don't invite this chaos back into your home.
I‚Äôm in Donegal to get away from the 12th.

Got stopped by the guards and they asked to see if we had masks and hand gel etc.

Wasn‚Äôt pissed off about it as I think it‚Äôs a good measure, but when you see this it sickens yer pish.

Stopping Irish people crossing the border but not (probably) infected Americans without so much as anything.
Getting a bit ridiculous now they are completely ignoring people‚Äôs concerns. Shut the airports for non essential travel and let us clear the virus in the our communities and maybe we can have some normality until a vaccine is available
I'm American and I 100 % agree please bar our country the president is incompetent
I am an American and I approve this message. America has like 1/4th of all covid cases in the world and a bit over 1/5th of covid related deaths in the world. We suck ass and should be banned from traveling to other countries if they know what's good for them.
American here.  It's in your best interest to block all Americans from your soil....

I own my own business, and Im dead ass serious when I say maybe 5% of my client's wear a mask ...  


Hell! I get shit for wearing a mask lol....

At this point I'm just tryna earn as much as possible , and then im dipping the hell out.
I‚Äôm an American myself and I completely support this. Our country is a fucking mess and we should not be endangering the rest of the world by our stupidity.
American here. I just want to get the hell out of here with all that‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôd gladly self isolate for weeks and get tested a hundred times over if it meant I could go someplace that‚Äôs handling this thing well, like New Zealand.
As a Texan who would live to visit Ireland,

Please ban the fuck out of us. The only thing our leaders care about is money.

Can you start an embargo or something with us? Really hit America in the pocketbook?

Dude, please?

They might start to take this seriously if you do. 

Help.
American here. Don‚Äôt let us in! Are you nuts? Our news is a damn reality TV show bordering on horror. On a sad note, I was supposed to be in Ireland today but, for obvious reasons, we canceled our vacation. Stay safe over there!
This is Trumps most cunning plan.. The Mexicans are currently taking bids on constructing a wall.. Trumps a fucking genius
Just emailed all my local TDs. I think its completely worthwhile for as many people to do this as possible and do not stop hassling them next week.
Yanks at it again.
Please do, I don‚Äôt want anyone to think I‚Äôm a tourist...
I‚Äôve lived here for three year and I‚Äôm worried about someone starting something with me over my accent... never gotten any flack before but it‚Äôs never been this kind of situation before.
As an American, ban us or face the wrath of a thousand Karens
Such an insult to everyone who lost their lives more like.
They should close the pubs to. did you see everyone in Dublin how desperate are you for a drink
Didn't Europe ban Americans from coming tho?
It doesn't matter if they are banned or not. They can still get into this country through northern Ireland. Plus they also don't have to self isolate for 2 weeks if they arrive through Belfast.
american here. i wouldn't trust any flight coming out of the US no matter how many precautions are being taken. there are simply too many idiots here thinking masks are an assault on their freedom walking around spreading COVID. it's so frustrating.
As an American who has visited Ireland and longs to return one day...I agree. If everyone in my stupid country could just stop being a selfish cockwobble for a little bit things would be so much better. But alas...here we are.
As an American, I support this message.
As an American, every country should.
Mask wearing isolated American here, this is why we can't have nice things.
>Ban Americans traveling until they sort their shit out

So it's gonna be a permanent ban?
Damn right, let Clown World figure it's shit out.
Please everyone just ban us from leaving our country fucking embargo us we need to sort our shit out
Shut it down, **we are an island.** New Zealand case in point. Unless you hold an Irish passport sorry you can't arrive. And go the same out, you can't leave unless you go into lockdown when you get back. Of all the fucking places to have a best zombie apocalypse and live, is an island.
i recommend a perma ban for all us citizens to the eu
American here. Please do our, leaders are retarded and our citizens are more retarded. The last thing anyone should want is somewhere from here. The fact that people don‚Äôt want wear masks and get together in large groups is ridiculous
I honestly hope we get banned from every country. Maybe it'll help these morons realize that we obviously did something wrong
I'm an American, I was supposed to be going to County Mayo in mid July for a family reunion/inauguration of sorts. I cancelled everything. I live in a state that refuses to make masks mandatory and has one of the fastest growing infection rates. I haven't seen my mom since March because I work in a very fast paced retail environment. This was a personal choice for me because I wouldn't want to expose anyone to anything I've been exposed to. They make me so sick not making this na easy choice
Due to my work I see certain statistics and you would have no idea of the amount of people that arrived in Ireland from feb to June. Its really shocking stuff.
Is your Govt not restricting travel from the USA?
They fucking well should be if they aren't.
Rise up, give your Govt a reason to pay attention to reality
Any country that allows Americans in right now has no love for it's citizens.  This coming from an American. Not only do we not have it together, Disney World opened today while the virus is raging outside it's gates. What a hot mess.

Edit: added info
Take a shot everytime someone mentions they're American
As an American, it sucks that most of us want to do the right thing. Its prolly just 20% that make up the dumbass population, and a shit government. A lot of local governments are doing a good job, but then theres Florida, fuck Florida.
They are not bringing their best people.
Hey! As an American let me tell you one thing, buddy... I totally agree. I don't think it's safe to allow people from here to travel there right now. My state even has a mandated mask order and there are still so many who won't do it. Canada has the right idea and I hope they're smart enough to keep the border closed as well.
If every single American had Covid-19, there is zero chance that our government will ever suspend or ban flights from the US. It's not even being contemplated or entertained. That's because our pathetic government are completely terrified that banning flights from the US or UK or anywhere would constitute some sort of insult to these countries and adversely affect foreign direct investment. They are terrified of Trump tweeting "So Ireland bans flights from USA? Maybe I'll ban US companies avoiding tax over there!"
Airports and Ports should be shut for tourists. Unless goods are being shipped, there's no need for travel in the world right now.
I am an American and I hate what is going on in this country. I want to go somewhere else, not to push an American agenda but to live in peace (at least somewhere more peaceful than the US). Please know that what is going on isn‚Äôt a reflection of all a Americans but the media only shows the bad things going on.
As an American, I agree wholeheartedly
Then ban china , south America , middle east, britan, india, africa and the philippines.!!!
I live in Seattle. 

I want nothing more than to go home to Derry right now.

But it shouldn't be allowed.
American here- don't let us in.
Fine. I didn't want to go anyway! üò≠
I'm just kidding. Please fucking ban us.
They're already blaming youn people for the spike in infections
I think most of the flights have been banned, right? The only exceptions are people that need to travel for education/ work purposes and in these cases they are demanded to stay 15 days in isolation once they arrive in Ireland.
Just contacted my local TD.
Have u guys seen the bullshit spewing out of Fox News? Lol the more surprising thing is people buy into it lol
The EU gov will probably put pressure on the Irish gov, or impose the same bans placed on America on Ireland
I thought the EU ban Americans? Isn't Ireland a part of the EU?
American here who loves to wander your country- long past time to ban our collective asses from coming over.   


My region (New England) has its collective shit together finally while  the rest of the country is rapidly becoming  a friggin shit show.  To make life worse, we're getting infested with touroids from the now shit show areas and we can't ban them from showing up and spreading plague.  


But you guys sure as hell can ban us.  Please do so.
[deleted]
I'm an American and I agree. We aren't even halfway through it.
Makes no sense as we are closed off for a lot of other countries (even the 14 day rule doesn't apply, they are straight up barred entry)
Two years ago I had my ticket to come over (from US). Passport issues killed that trip. Had my ticket this past April to try again. Y‚Äôall know what happened this time. I promise you, until we are safe to travel, I will stay home. I can only apologize for the asses that care more for their own pleasures than anyone else‚Äôs health and well being. 

PLEASE don‚Äôt let us in.
I do agree there doesn‚Äôt seem much benefit not doing this , but having spent the last week travelling around Kerry I can confirm the rumours of Americans crowding every bar in Killarney are a tad embellished. .. as in I haven‚Äôt come across a single one. The principle is fair, but let‚Äôs not get too carried away with how disastrous this is .
As an American,  please keep us out for the foreseeable future.
Look at the parties happening in the Southern US.........dangerous stuff
I wouldn't allow us in
American here, I agree wholeheartedly.
this is fucking hilarious and very handy as I can show it to clueless yanks whom think america must be doing just as bad as anywhere else...

northern ireland is another point of concern as they've relaxed their travel restrictions.
As an American, I would have to agree. I really wish we would get our shit together. Our covid response has been a joke. I don‚Äôt want our stupidity to endanger the people of Ireland, or anywhere else for that matter.
I‚Äôm an American, and I agree with you.
As an American, after reading this post I feel targeted, threatened, and I demand to speak to the manager of Ireland.
Absolutely the rest of the world should ban American tourism for the foreseeable future. 

Source: Am American. We done fucked up.
We should build a wall around America..  /s
Yeah, we suck.  Sorry.  I had a nice time there over New year's though.  I'll be back when this is all over.  It's seriously not fair that you can get garlic sauce literally everywhere, I still come complain to my wife about how nobody here has any.
American here: fuck yeah, please show intelligence because apparently we can't.
What the fuck! I thought they were stopped
American here, I completely understand. If we can‚Äôt behave in our own country, I don‚Äôt see why other countries should have to deal with it.
As an American I can say without a doubt. üëäü§°üëç We're all a fucking joke.
This fucking sucks, I hate living here. I come back every summer to visit my dad and cousins and this is the first time since i moved where I can‚Äôt and it‚Äôs solely down to my shithole country
I am an American and I endorse this message.
American here üëã
Please ban us! I firmly believe every country should ban US travellers.

We're a bunch of idiots, and those are us who aren't idiots are still getting sick.
(I've gotten Corona somehow while doing all recommend safe practices, masks, social distancing, hand washing, limiting shopping trips to once a week max.)

Please keep us out of your countries!
American here, and I completely agree. These people are just straight up retarded, no way around it. We can‚Äôt even fight off a virus without starting a race war like damn. Our priorities are wack.
I‚Äôm an American and I ABSOLUTELY agree!
I am from America. It was a very wise decision for America to block people from other countries coming into our country, which is ironic, considering how much flak we got for it. It slowed the spread quite a bit until we just gave up and said it was too difficult to stop.

From this point of view, you absolutely should close your borders to travellers from America, making as few exceptions as possible.
I'm American.  I hope every sensible country bans us. Its hard to have hope for any intelligent leadership here but if we start seeing "real" repercussions for our idiocy then maybe people will be forced to take this shit more seriously. I put real in quotes because obviously the 100k+ dead isn't enough of a repercussion for some people.
American here.  You should definitely ban Americans indefinitely.  It's unbelievable what idiots we have over here.
As a citizen, family man and small business owner im disgusted at the lack of leadership and decision making by our government. We've all worked damn hard to get ourselves to a point where we can interact with each other. 
At the very least the people that we allow within our boarders should commit to our level attentiveness to public health.
American here. Yeah, we should be banned! I left Ireland on March 15 and am ashamed by the way the people and the government is(not) handling the pandemic!
I'm over here in Canada hoping they stop letting the fuckers in because they're "going to alaska".

Take a plane or a boat you fucks!
I'm American and want to ban other Americans from coming to our state. People are beyond stupid.
American here. I would love to visit your beautiful country some day but it won‚Äôt happen until this country gets its shit in order. In my opinion no one should be allowed to leave this country at this time.
As an American, I wouldn't let me in.
American here, I fully support this.
As an American, you gotta do it.  It‚Äôs too much a risk.
American here, do yourself a favor and ban us for eternity. We are honestly more trouble than we're worth.
Am American, don't let us anywhere fucking near you.
Your hotels are open? They're still not open in Scotland (that I'm aware of) so hard to be a tourist unless you're sleeping in a ditch or something

But yeah that's pretty shitty. US cases are way higher now than they were in March at the start of all this.
Please do. We suck.
As an American I am truly sorry that people from my country have the nerve to travel to other countries at a time like this. Its pretty fucking embarrassing tbh
Massachusetts here. Damn straight advise. Trump is destroying America.
I am american, plz don't let us enter your country.
You're thinking about this all wrong. Let Americans (and others) in, but require they spend their quarantines at high end hotels with lots of cameras and eat and drink using room service only. (slightly /s)
We are so fucked here in the US.
As an American, I concur. We're a shithole country at the moment.
American af. Totally agree.
Canadian here. Stars above help us, ban them.
As an American, yeah that‚Äôs the best call. There are a lot of us still social distancing, wearing masks, and constantly washing our hands, but so many more who don‚Äôt care. You‚Äôve gotta do what‚Äôs safe and sadly, we as a group are too fucking stupid to be safe
I agree. I will vote blue this time, but I‚Äôm nervous we‚Äôll just see a terrible back and forth from now on with each side forcing us to vote for the lesser of evils now that they‚Äôve figured it out this past cycle.
As an American, I agree. Place is a disease ridden shithole.
I'm American and I agree with this
As an American, yes you really shouldn't let any of us in.
American here, born a raised here. PLEASE DO!! So many people still don't take this shit seriously and it shows. Please protect your own. Plus, shutting us off might make people see how serious it is. I am 100% all for other countries closing their boarders to us, I'm pretty sure Canada and Mexico already have. If I could get out of this country I absolutely would. Americans are not safe right now and even before all this, we were not very good for the rest of the world. Don't let Americans undo all the hard work and shit you all already had to go through to get your people in a safe situation. Most Americans still think it's a political hoax which absolutely dumbfounds me. We already cause enough death and destruction as it is we don't need to help spread this deadly virus to the countries that have finally come out of there battle. If we fall, let us fall. The world doesn't deserve to suffer because our people can't get there own heads out of there own asses.
As an American I support this.
Everyone should now refer to it as the ‚ÄúAmerican virus‚Äù when speaking to Trump.
American here. Ban the fuck out of us. please. the smart people among us aren't trying to travel. it's only the idiots. ban travel.
American here. Every country should absolutely block Americans from entering, you are 100% correct. We don't deserve the rest of the world if we pretend reality is fake. Anyone saying this is hate speech, etc, is an American that is angry for being called out on their bullshit.
American, that is completely understandable and responsible. The states are a shit show
My wife and I wanted to visit next year. We've decided against it because of what's happening over here. Hope everything goes well for y'all.
Ban Americans from everything not American. They love their country so much, let em sit in it. With everything happening in America right now, nothing good can come from them.
American here,  don't let us in....
I am an American and a nurse. Stay alive. Keep us out until collectively we stop being shits.
As an American, please ban us. The last thing the world needs is more idiots running around spreading this stuff again. And maybe if we get banned from enough places we'll take it seriously, though I don't anything can change some of these peoples minds
American here, please, don‚Äôt fucking let a single one of us in. Our ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù doesn‚Äôt know what the fuck he‚Äôs doing. Ban us until we get our shit straight.
American here. I am 100% in agreement everyone else needs to ban us from your countries!  I‚Äôm following mask and social distancing protocols but am so disappointed at the amount of stupidity around me...smh...
As a citizen of said infected hell hole:

Lock us out like we're the ward in the Walking Dead's first episode
American, here. Please keep us out, for now.

America has lost its fucking mind, and we need to sort out some shit. I mean, *obviously*, right?
American here. 


Do it for the love of god, US tourists, tourists in general, can just be such selfish idiots, they have no care for other people‚Äôs safety, and plus they can bring the rona to Ireland. Stay safe broskis.
From America. Visited your beautiful country. 


Ban us. We don‚Äôt have our shit together. Just remember it‚Äôs not every Americans fault :/
Same in Canada....they decided to let Americans in who had elderly relatives here and they have been violating our quarantine regulations and causing infections in areas where they have had no cases for weeks! So maddening and unnecessary.
American here - please ban us. Seriously, don‚Äôt let us into your country.
Americans will be glad to tell you how much percentage of them are Irish... LMAO üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
American here. Please ban us. Seriously.
I‚Äôm a Hispanic American and I agree! üòÇ
American here. Don‚Äôt let us in. I beg you. Learn from our leadership‚Äôs mistakes and our country‚Äôs idiots.
I emailed the new Minister for Health 6 days ago. He has yet to respond, not even an automated email.
Irish government hungry for American money. 
I'm appalled we nearly got rid of covid and here our new government is welcoming the second wave right to our doors.
Cancel flights to all countries failing to contain the pandemic, THIS IS COMMON SENSE.
As an American, I upvote this.  Americans, please just stay home.
From an American, hell yeah block us.
You're right. We don't have our shit together here at all. I'm in Massachusetts, we almost have our shit together, but unless we blockade the mouth-breathers from outside New England soon, it won't matter. Save yourselves, it's too late for us.
As an Italian-American, I approve.
American here: please make us suffer. There‚Äôs no reason for anyone in this country to travel. People here are being infect and dying on a massive scale. Because so many still choose to believe that the virus will just miraculously disappear in November (our presidential election).
Am American, am fine with this. We deserve it for letting the idiots breed.
American here. Screw off for being so right lol we're number one in all the wrong metrics thanks to our man child president, fact-denying populist idiot. Keep us away at all costs, even the sane ones. We understand.
American here.  Agree 100%.
As an American who had his honeymoon in Ireland - I support this. We‚Äôre idiots, and it saddens me.
As an American I fully support this. We are the height of stupidity.
American here. I agree with the travel ban. And I apologize for America being America.
As an American,  I fully support this. This country is mostly morons who can't help but hurt themselves and not give a damn if they hurt others. I have so little faith in humanity anymore.
Please ban us. Do whatever you can to stop the spread while this retard in office does the exact opposite.
As an American who has visited Ireland and wishes to do so again some day... yes, ban our stupid asses.
As an American, I support this. I wouldn‚Äôt want us anywhere near your country either right now.
As an Alaskan, I couldn't agree more.
Another American here. BAN US please. A message needs to be sent. We are struggling here.
American here. First off, yeah, sorry, we are trying our best to get him the fuck out, and two, please ban us. We deserve this hell, but not everyone is like it.
Please do. If we survive this shit our 5 year goal is to be living in Ireland. Been trapped in this hellhole for a few generations, since my ancestors arrived at Ellis Island.
We have the problem of Americans coming up to bc claiming to be going to Alaska then actually illegally staying in Canada. Legit just had a guy infect 3 other people and get federally quarantine. Somehow the Canadian government isn't banning Americans entry all together.
Yankee here, completely agree. Y‚Äôall probably should just keep us out indefinitely. As you well know we can be obnoxious
We‚Äôll have our trash cleaned up by November
As an American, please lock your borders down and save yourself. Do no be stupid. This is a great opertunity to not have people requesting Bud Light in your pubs. I'm not sure it's not in your best interest to never let us back in.
ITT: "As an American..."
My s/o and I have been planning our move (which is in 3 weeks!!!) since November. Absolute shit timing but we‚Äôre taking precautions and will be quarantining when we arrive. Definitely understand shutting down travel from here though, it really doesn‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs a pandemic going on at all. The state we live in is one of the worst atm and it‚Äôs been tough isolating ourselves so we don‚Äôt get exposed but it‚Äôll be worth it! I‚Äôm not sure what we‚Äôre going to do if travel is shut down, it‚Äôs certainly very worrying
You shouldn‚Äôt let anyone in. The Brits are probably bringing it in too.
Man us teenagers are trying our best for lockdown, and now Trump is threatening to cut funding to schools if they don't reopen... What a wee cunt
I‚Äôm American and I agree, keep us the fuck out. Half our country are idiots
As an American, do it. Maybe the morons with self righteous bullshit will realize the world does not revolve around them - or even want their presence.
I‚Äôm American and I think should happen!!
American here. We just found out our grandma has it. She‚Äôs in a home, and she hasn‚Äôt been around any family members. But even after receiving that news yesterday, I just had to explain to a family member today, for like the fifth time, why/how wearing masks helps stop the spread of the virus. I‚Äôd ban us too.
Sounds fair, they should follow your advice. As a American I say go for it.
American here.  You‚Äôre absolutely right - no country on the mend should allow Americans in.
Let‚Äôs be clear:it is absolutely the right of Irish people to decide who they want in their country.

If America cared for even a second about their citizens welcome overseas, maybe they should have thought about that before gargling the idiot ball on Covid. Anyone that‚Äôs mad about this needs to talk to their Senators and Governors, not /r/Ireland.

I‚Äôm American, for what that‚Äôs worth.
Canadian here. Even we have shut down our border with the U.S.
Dunno, seems kinda racist
America Lost so much credibility over this shit, it's hard to believe how fucking stupid we are as Americans
Another American here to say ya definitely don‚Äôt let us in haha. We shouldn‚Äôt even be allowed to move around within the country honestly
I'm an American, and it's ridiculous that you people think that you should go around restricting our travel. 

*We* should be restricting it. A lot. You shouldn't have any obligation to do so.
Politicians to afraid to stand up for the people they are supposed to represent. Grow a pair and ban travel until this pandemic is under control worldwide. It‚Äôs an insult to our health workers etc who have been putting their life at risk for months. And if the north want to allow anyone to travel turn them back at the border. How many people have to die before they cop the fuxk on
Imagine how us Canadians feel.
It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous, sacrificed months to suppress the virus . The first time it came in from Italy, same way through flights. 

I think nearly all other countries in Europe are banning flights from highly infected areas . I‚Äôve heard a few Americans on the streets of Dublin and it‚Äôs very uncomfortable. 

The thing is , a lot of Irish people are going on holidays too . There were 15 cases last week that were travel related . Absolutely fuckery of the finest level . Cases are back up to double figures and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they go up to 3 by the end of July / mid August .
American here.

Please block me and my countrymen from entering, our governments response (and people) shows we don't care about anybody else.

As much as I'd love to be able to visit your beautiful country, your citizens take first priority. 

Much love from the other side of the pond, and I hope you stay safe and healthy.
Yea I'd suggest keeping us out.
As an American I agree
Apparently there was a flight that came in from
Dallas yesterday. I mean wtf? Its got over 1000 new cases daily at this point.
Hundreds of Americans are coming to do Donegal via Belfast it's fucking disgusting
Americans here! Please don‚Äôt let us in, half our country is in a cult and refuses to wear a mask. The more people to exclude us from travel the more the USA government *might* consider this a serious fucking matter
American here. I agree. Please, every country block travel from the US. We aren't really that great of tourists to begin with. I understand if your country needs the money from tourism, but in my opinion the dollars are not worth the lives.
As an American (non dumbass) this is completely reasonable.  Our administration is a complete disaster and they're robbing us blind to boot.
Paddy whack all yanks on site
As an American I strongly agree
On behalf of my fellow countrymen, I apologize for the sizable portion of them who were fucking idiots and began protesting lockdowns. It‚Äôs unbelievable. There are a lot of us who are still on lockdown and have been since the beginning though. I‚Äôm on month 5
American here. Please ban us.
As an American, Ireland should be blocking Americans from entry.  Please send help!
Please ban us
As an American I agree on this! 


Every country that followed quarantine orders should either ban us or 14 day quarantine anyone coming from a country that didn't. 


We have idiots preaching that they can't force us to wear masks... stupid selfish idiots. Not all of us are like that though. Some of us are taking it serious and did and are still quarantining as well as willing and happily wearing masks. So my hope is that only those who took caution and cared for others survive and then those selfish idiots that didn't don't.  

They contribute nothing to the community and endanger others, hopefully they learn the hard way.
Yeah you should absolutely fight us coming.

Apparently our nation is chalk full of selfish assholes.

Which I sort of knew, I mean I knew...but now i REALLY REALLY know.
Thought the EU was handling this?

ps: American here, but living in Ireland for 10 years now. Thank fuck.
As an American, I have to say this is fucking ridiculous. 


Nobody should be letting Americans in their country right now. I wouldn't even let an American in my *house*, and I live here! These fucking lemmings have been throwing so-called "Covid Parties" where large groups of untested people gather without masks on. The goal? To flaunt their utter disrespect for other people's health and safely. Then they act shocked when they get sick.
Here here from the other side of the Irish Sea. America's a mess right now, and they're putting us at risk.
American here. Please do, we want more incentive to stay quarantined.
As an American, I agree.
They are flying in from Belfast and then traveling around Kerry. Unless Ireland blocks off NI it is up to the UK to stop them
As an American, I totally agree
As an American I approve of this message.
Why do we let stupid people govern us?
It doesn't help that the Americans most likely to travel are also the ones who are least likely to wear a mask, distance, or take any symptoms seriously.

It's almost certain that we will get a second wave from this. Its how the virus got here in the first place after all.

The government is brain dead. We need to be extra careful now with our distancing and mask wearing. Best thing to do is stop the spread amongst Irish people.
I like the first two words best. American Tourists are destroying Ireland's culture.
As an American who wants to visit Ireland really really badly, I 100% agree.
Someone told me it's not that easy. That it would take at least 4 years to get a ruling of that size
Please don't move here. Ireland is crowded enough as it is, it isn't fair on the people who live here who need their jobs back, it isn't our fault your ruler is ridiculous. Nothing against anyone but it isn't fair for loads of people to be moving here and taking up space and homes
Honestly as an American I‚Äôm ashamed that America is being lead by an... orange-Itan
Block the airports as the flights start coming in.
You think we got control over our fascist government? Look at the Portland protests.
I am from the U.S. I agree with this, my county needs to fix itself.
The struggle is real: The indignity of trying to follow an American recipe when you‚Äôre Irish.

Same craic following American woodworking plans. 7/8 of an inch and such. Have Alexa set up at my bench to convert stuff. Handy but a pain in the arse all the same.
I was on an American website that had the option to change from imperial to metric. 1/2 tbsp became 0.5 tbsp. Feckin handy that was.
The worst thing in recipes is that the ingredient "is available in most supermarkets", when I see that I 100% know it is not, Jamie Oliver was the worst for it
 But consider the Americans in Ireland discovering what a "couple of pints" means.
Kosher salt.
I kind of get the others, but who the fuck doesn't know what a bell pepper is?

The concept of "a stick of butter" is infuriating to me.

I also hate cup measures with a fucking passion. Just use milliliters and grams you American fucks!
Stick to BBC Good Food and you'll be alright.  

Edit to add: Jamie Oliver's site is a safe bet also.
[deleted]
How the fuck did you find the recipe hidden in the 30 pages of their authors fucking life story.
Wait bell pepper isn‚Äôt American term is it?
Have you a problem with freedom units or something? /s
Hahaha, my girlfriend does this when she's using recipes from the US. Drives me mad, I can't use anything American. If I'm ever searching for a recipe I add BBC to it.

The yanks are always going on about cups of things. Any Irish person knows that there are hundreds of different types of cup
Cilantro=Coriander
Is a "cup" a standard measure or literally an actual cup? I've been so afraid to ask
I'm fully Filipino and I have a similar problem but with Irish and British recipes. What the hell even is a rocket?!
for the curious:

arugula = rocket? that's the only other name I know it by. it's a leafy green. 

bell pepper = capsicum or sweet pepper

1 cup = 236.6 mL liquid, around 130 grams dry ingredients like flour (but your mileage may vary, dry ingredients can measure weird in cups and I concede that grams is the superior way to go here)

1 stick of butter = 1/2 cup = 113 grams

cilantro = coriander leaf

source: am American but cook often enough to frequently have the inverse of this problem.
This is why we had it right first time around.

Take meat. Add oats. Add potato. Boil of 9 hours. Will keep for 6 months.
Nobody asked what you were making! Tell us!
Have dealt with those for many years, but the worst thing is temperature conversion charts only going between F and C, and never a gas mark to be seen.
Weird that OP didn‚Äôt credit the author of this joke https://twitter.com/amyohconnor/status/1265286753096814601
Fuck me who ya tellin. My ex found a recipe online years ago for some American fast food cookie, I dunno some biscuity shite. Because we no speak Americano , the measurements were way off. Long story short way to many oats were used, cookie was a gigantic slab of crumbs and it smelled like a Quaker farted in my kitchen.
"Add one packet of Ranch"  WTF???
Thats why I love the first binging with Babish cookbook, he has an index table of Americanisms
Hey Google - "what's 400 degrees Fahrenheit in Celsius again?"
Bell Pepper is what they are here though..?
Tunisian here ü§öüèª and I'm here to say that the imperial measuring system can fuck right off. Have to spend 10 minutes converting everything to metric so I can make a brownie.
I wouldn't call it indignity when someone else starts speaking in code..... Unless your still trying to push the eggplant or zucchini into the auld mars bar mug you got at Easter.
What is any of that shite
Omg! Cilantro lol, for the longest time I thought it was some exotic spice, but it‚Äôs just coriander...
If you are going to do a lot of cooking following US recipes, you should invest in a measuring cup like this 

https://www.amazon.co.uk/International-Cookware-Arcuisine-Borosilicate-Measuring/dp/B00L2IG1SY/ref=mp_s_a_1_4

And a set of measuring spoons. 1/2 teaspoon, 1/4 teaspoons etc pre-measured out. https://www.amazon.co.uk/KitchenCraft-Colourworks-Piece-Measuring-Spoon/dp/B003SZU66W/ref=mp_s_a_1_3
ok, maybe not the point of the post but while we're here can I yell about the fucking recipe format that gives me the instructions in one place and the measurements in another section roughly 10km away?? WHO DECIDED THIS WAS THE WAY?? WHOEVER THEY ARE, I HATE THEM!

its awful! Why don't we put our measurements in our instructions! Now there's flour all over my phone! 

/rant
I had a rough time learning to cook when I was younger. I would watch Gordon Ramsay and such. Being American I was doing the reverse of this screenshot, lol.

Wtf is corriander? Oh cilantro. How much butter is a knob? How many grams in a cup? What the hell is creme fraiche?
Y'all, I'm *crying* at this thread. We always have people come onto the New Orleans subreddit and ask about making local dishes, and I always feel so bad when they're international people like...what is roux, what is fil√© powder, what's the holy trinity, WHY DO Y'ALL HAVE WEIRD NEW ORLEANS NAMES FOR EVERYTHING?
American here.  Good morning from Boston. If it makes you feel any better, I bought Mary Berry‚Äôs baking book because of the show and it‚Äôs almost unusable. We don‚Äôt have caster sugar outside of very particular import shops (our granulated sugar which is smaller than your granulated sugar in terms of grain size is still too big). I had to Google some of the flour types and while you can get self rising flour here, it fell out of fashion and nine out of 10 bags on the grocery store sell or not that and you can only get it bleached from some crap flower brand.

A cup is 454 mL or 8 fl oz and it‚Äôs a very particular item that people buy for baking (I rather your mom got a set of measuring cups when she got married and has never had to buy new ones again). A cup is a half pint, but I think that Europeans might have redefined those to be metric. I met someone who used actual cups for measuring but she also complained to me that her recipes never come out for some reason‚Ä¶. If you were measuring out a cup of flour you need to stir the flour to loosen it, then spoon it gently into the cup and level it off without packing any of the flour. Every single thing that asks for a cup assumes that you have filled it up but then scraped off the top so it‚Äôs completely flat.

Our sticks of butter are 113 g (I just checked), and are officially half cup, volume wise and comes with markings for 8 tablespoons that you can cut with a knife. 

You probably call arugula ‚Äúrocket‚Äù. 

Bell peppers are among the commonly found peppers in our grocery stores in the vegetable section. These are the kind of peppers better you grow and eat the skin, not the salt and pepper kind of pepper (peppercorns). They‚Äôre more cylindrical shaped then bell shaped. But they are not pointy like a lot of the peppers that you might grow in a garden or hot peppers. They are bigger than a fist (maybe about the size of two small adult hands clasped together and not at all hot. They are picked when they are green, yellow, orange or red and will have very different flavors depending on the color. Bell peppers are a common grocery item by another name, you can just substitute in any non-hot flavored pepper that you like.
If you don't know what a bell pepper is the issue may lie elsewhere.
The cup thing is annoying, so I use a mug.
This is why I have both metric and US measuring cups, it makes it that much easier.
Also, a block of butter here is the equivalent of four sticks of butter (or 2 US cups), so half a block is one cup (113.5g).

I may have quite a few US recipes saved...
Mate, just use BBC good food.
It's not just Ireland, it is literally every single country other than the USA
But better question
Why is cilantro
Much like how we feel in the US when we see a recipe that says to roast aubergine with 300g Parmesan in the oven at gas mark 4.
The most shocking thing I have ever attempted to eat was Chinese food in Galway. It was bright red slimy sweet dough with hard nuggets of dried pork embedded in it served over wet candied rice. And I thought mid-western Americans had shitty taste.
Americans have gone back a step on the evolutionary ladder. r/MetricMasterrace
My hatred for the cup as a unit of measurement is real. What size cup!?
Yo Irish friends. A cup isn't just any random ass cup you have. It's a standard unit of measure like ml
Ah-reg-eno. No, its Or-ee-ganno you fuckers.

Erbs? Why dont you pronounce the H you fuckers?
Best tip I can give. Don't follow american recipes.
Haha, that was me the other night. I ended up just throwing stuff into my recipe and it seemed to work. Toilet hasn't been the same though.
Amy o Conner? the original poster on twitter? is that you ?

If you're ever unclear, just ask a Canadian. We live in the terrible no-mans lands between Metric and Imperial where recipes will call for 3tbps of butter and 250ml of milk, a head of cilantro, coriander if you're feeling frisky, 8 inches of a celery stock, and a gram of salt.
Cilantro...TURNS OUT ITS JUST FUCKING CORRIANDER!!
what is a faucet?
As an American, this is how I feel when trying to follow European recipes - love the googling of what a bell pepper and stuck of butter are üòÇ
I wish you would have snuck a real existential tab in there.
Yesssss! Then add in the family background, the emotion behind the recipe blah blah blah! I just search for European recipes now.
Cup is such a dumb measurement, especially for dry ingredients that dont take into account how tightly packed in it is
I had this experience using an American wine recipe that used gallons which I thought was perfect for my UK gallon demijohns. It turns out US gallons are not the same as UK gallons.
2 cups one girl
I hear ya haha Looking for kosher salt when regular salt is perfectly fine hahah ü§£
And for the love of Jiminy, who the hell measures butter in cups?

I once asked an American foodie friend if she had a weighing scales in her kitchen and she stared at me and said "of course!"

So she *could* have weighed the butter instead of cramming it into greasy cups and teaspoons; just cut a slice off the block and weigh it, simples!

Also, cups are a volume, not a weight. One cup of cornstarch does NOT weigh the same as one cup of sugar. Translate cups into either mls, or "fluid ounces" (the size of an ounce of water)

Translate ounces/pounds into grams. 

Volume to volume, weight to weight.

Also, they say things like "one package of..." without saying what SIZE package!

And just as a public kindness, let me share that in the USA, a "square" of cooking chocolate means one ounce by weight. It took me years to establish this. You're welcome.
"a stick of butter" -- americans will measure with anything but the metric system
Okay but what are they all called in Ireland?
And this is after scrolling past the life story of the person and the journey they took to create this recipe.
Is butter not sold in sticks in Ireland?
[deleted]
Learn from your Canadian friends: just become fluent in every system while you wait (forever) for the Americans to see the light...
Ya but wtf is a scallion? 
 
This post brought to you by the rest of frikkin Europe

Edit: Thanks for the messages to everyone who doesn't understand sarcasm. Yes I do actually know what a scallion is; go eat a fucking rutabaga
Hey! Hey, you there! What the hell is this? (holds up a measuring cup)

That's an inferior measurement, Father.
My trick is I just wing it. 
 Yea that looks like a cup.
Yea thats about 6 inches.
This is probably a half stick of butter.

....i don't recommend this as a strategy.
So american here.... Wtf do the irish call cilantro? It's cilantro! Thats the only word i would use to describe it outside of the term "green leafy plant".
You guys don‚Äôt have bell peppers or cilantro?
As a Canadian, I have two questions:

1. Ireland doesn't have bell peppers?

2. Doesn't the UK use cups, too? Shouldn't you be used to that nonsense from your neighbours?
So how would an Irishman explain the answers to these questions?

I'm just curious.

Also whats up with stick of butter?  Do you just get yours in tubs or bars or something?
I can convert from freedom units to metrics no sweat (I have a cheat sheet with the conversions I use the most). But what infuriates me is when I search for recipes for something specific (like white cake), and it starts with "take a box of brand name cake mix...". Thanks, but that's not a fucking recipe! And those mixes aren't found here, give me a real recipe!
this is like reading a Mexican recipe and complaining when it's in Spanish
Am American and get annoyed when recipes call for a cup of butter... It's already in sticks. Just tell me the number of sticks so I don't have to mash butter down into a measuring cup.
American here! 

I'm now genuinely curious about butter in Ireland! What form does it typically come in? The butter I buy here in the US does come in "stick" form, and labels itself "Pure Irish Butter"... Apparently that's nonsense and I'm curious what actual Irish butter is like! I tried searching for it, but most of the results brought me back to the brand of "stick" butter that I buy which was super unhelpful.

Also using "1 stick of butter" is a horrible measurement even for us because it's wildly inconsistent. The sticks I buy are almost double the size of the brand my parents buy...
Fuck cilantro , it tastes like soap
Damn don‚Äôt sleep on cilantro...
As an American, this reminds me of when I read the first Harry Potter book and kept having to Google things like "treacle tart" and "kidney pie".
I‚Äôll trade you some good American recipes and authentic Cajun recipes I‚Äôm from Louisiana for some good Irish comfort food recipes and whatever else you would like to offer.
Not only Irish, the entire world faces the same issue
Meanwhile I'm looking at British recipes like "how many cups of flower is 3754 grams"
Don‚Äôt forget to add the eggplant and zucchini.
Cilantro is a weed that tastes like soap
As an American I hate when ingredients go buy measurements instead of weight. Especially for baking. So I feel ya.
What is a stick of butter?? Really?

Edit: I didn't mean to seem like idk what a stick of butter is. I'm American. I was just really surprised that a stick of butter would be called anything but a stick of butter in Ireland.
Every yank recipe uses 'kosher salt'. 

Turns out kosher salt is just salt in big grains. No idea where the kosher thing came from, isn't that like halal but Jewish?
[deleted]
I feel your pain with ingredients. It's just as confusing when you're an American reading British recipes. I'm doing what with a swede? Why is marrow in my salad? Or is it something else called "marrow"?

Don't get me started on types of flour.

As for conversions, I have a useful link for you: [Convert-Me](https://www.convert-me.com/en/). Check out the special "Cooking" section in the left-hand list!
FYI a US cup is 240ml but in other countries it's 250ml (changing after the metric system was implemented). Even a pint in the US is different it's 16 ounces not 20 ounces.

As a Canadian if I find a recipe from Europe or anywhere else I have to convert weight to volume. Now that I have a scale I prefer weight but now I have to convert cups to grams.
Hahah love this also what is an agrula??
Or just generally European
I'm from South America. I just Google alternatives to ingredients I know will be too expensive or jusy not avaliable in my country.
Bro, what? What do you call bell peppers even? Cilantro is the same in Spanish. And what do you call arugula?
This is a daily struggle! I cannot believe Kerry Gold is my go to

Thanks a lot guys! It is so nice to see the whole world show love to a small country by the name of Croatia.

Love from HRVATSKA <3
I was in Croatia for work a few years ago. Definitely worth the visit. Any Croatian I've met over the years (a good few), all been sound out. Savage ice cream there too. 
Should we not send them over a few bags of spuds, boxes of Tayto and bottles of Finches orange or something ?

As a thank you like.
Love ya too Ireland! Met some amazing people here, as well my SO. I am very grateful for that! Thank you Ireland!
Brit bloke here. I come here for the banter, always some good shit on this sub.

Keep it up yer green bastards. 

Also congrats to any Croatians in this thread, routing for you vs the frogs
Genuinely rooting for Croatia, I don't care whether England made it to the final even, I'm just rooting for the little guy to win. The world Cup has the same teams win over and over again, it'd be awesome to see the underdog win and knock all the cockiness out of the bigger teams. Go on Croatia!! 
Slogan for Croatia 2018: ‚ÄòCroatia full of life‚Äô,

Great bunch of lads indeed. The stamina, the great offensive pressure, it's fun to watch. I hope you all take care of France. Side note,  you mofos are always good in water polo as well.

Sooooo ... go Croatia! 

Thanks you Irish folks, I love you :) 
I'm in London right now. Supporting Croatia wasn't awkward at all at all at all at all.

Thank you so much for supporting us! Lots of love from Croatia to all Irish and Ireland!!üáÆüá™üá≠üá∑
Damn, this is your top post of all time. You are a bunch of living legends. Love you lads <3
Hvala Irci <3
We said it's coming home, but we just didn't say when.

And as a Brit, well done to Croatia on their victory! Well deserved lads.
as a croatian married to a irish-man this sub has been wonderful for me. ta
I was in croatia once... its essentially a sandy sunny warm athlone.
Great day for the parish
It's on to the final for these fellas.
We do love an underdog...
When I was inter railing a couple of years ago we ended up in Split in Croatia towards the end of our trip. Stayed in a lovely hostel just outside of town. 10 minute drive into the town centre roughly. First night there we all pre - swalled in the gaff and then got the bus into town to hit a pub crawl. On that bus journey, which was literally 10 minutes long, about 12 of the most beautiful women I‚Äôve ever seen in my life got on and off. Not altogether or anything. Literally all individual girls just going about there day, all supermodel esque women. So yea, great bunch of Lassies too.
Englishman in Canada here....fair play the better team won today.  Now go an mashup some frogs good for us eh?
"They're going home, they're going home... England is going home."
God I‚Äôm up near the living room on O‚ÄôConnell street, place is like little Croatia it‚Äôs absolutely buzzing! 
TO THE FRONT PAGE, LADS

THEY'RE GOING TO THE FRONT PAGE
Congrats, Ireland. Basically a win for you guys. 


I also enjoy seeing England lose at things, especially soccer. 
Thanks guys!
And thank you for being our friends. There is some kind of connection.
Also, please don't be mad at us who are working in Ireland. Currently Croatia is in deep shit with labor force and many people seek chance outside our borders. Salaries are low and working conditions are terrible. Hopefully that will change too and we will go back to Croatia. 
I hope we are not being considered as weight to your society. Also I hope we are being nice and we respect country which gave many of us chance to work. Thank you. 
As an Englishman, congrats! Seriously, football fans here are very obnoxious and I enjoyed their disappointment just as much as the Irish and Croatians here. :)
Greetings from r/scotland! We're happy too!
I love this sub
Good! About time Croatia, a country almost no one ever talks about, gets to shine as an underdog in the world stage against a world power in sports!
England fan here and all I can say is congrats to  Croatia. First world cup final and I wish them all the best. 
We're all going to heaven lads weeeeyyyyyy
As celebration everyone should go to the Balkan restaurant on Moore Street.

Yer man the owner will be fuming. 
A fucking great bunch of lads. Hon the Croatians!!!üá≠üá∑üá≠üá∑üá≠üá∑üá≠üá∑

I live in Cork. I can't fucking wait to go to work tomorrow!
Scotland and Ireland joint hosts in 2030 LETS DO IT
The better team won.
English here. Some of my simpler countrymen seem to have been absolutely hoisted by the banter here. Hilarious and slightly shocking. 

Please carry on, congrats Croatia.

PS. You can see the nasty removed comments here: https://www.removeddit.com/r/ireland/comments/8y34m6/croatia_great_bunch_of_lads/
One of my teachers was a Croatian dude with a ponytail, good guy.
≈Ωivila Hrvatska!
Good job brothers!!
Greetings from Belarus!!
Just came here to upvoted this!

With love from Italy...
Good footballers the Croatians, well they youshed to be anyway. 
I‚Äôm English but an Irish fan sent me a pic before the game that said 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather guide my Father into my Mother than support England‚Äù
Best Balkan Slavic Nation Ever!!!!!
I'm Iranian. We also HATE the English and like Croatians. Also my sis is married to an O'Brian.
Top lads
I hereby vote to induct Croatia as the 27th county!
The brits are fucking out. 
Wish I could buy you a drink
Put twenty on Croatia to win! I'll save it for the day I visit Croatia! 
Greatest lads to ever play the game, our fate would have been horrible if they didn't play class tonight
Haha, I feel like I will be seeing a lot of this on reddit today. 
Sort by controversial 
I‚Äôm here just to upvote this!
This is fucking hilarious xD 
That Luka Madra fella would make a handy corner forward.
Revenge for Skibereen!
I fell in love with this team back in 1998 World Cup...I've been with them ever since!

I know they and believe that they will beat those stupid nasty french!

Nobody likes the French! 
Well I‚Äôve lived in England for a long time, so I was fully behind the team. I think they did great and have done their country proud. The atmosphere here has been amazing. I know it‚Äôs all just a bit of fun, but it does leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth to see my home country take quite so much pleasure in the England team‚Äôs disappointment... and this is coming from someone who loves beating England as much as anyone (especially in the rugby). 
You're Going Home... You're Going Home.... You're Going.... England's Going Home!!!
What's the Croatian for "its coming home?"
I‚Äôve always said it, every chance I get I remind people just how sound them Croatians are. 
Wanna hear a joke?

It's coming home lmao.
Ingerland were busy spewing shite about "football coming home" while also thrashing their local Ikea 

Croatia were at this time instead clearly working hard on the training pitch.

Coulda been 3/4-1 easily enough. 

I noticed also that when Southgate was being a gentleman hugging all off the players in turn he had to stoop down to ground level for Maguire who was so busy diving towards the end of extra time he hadn't noticed the match was over.....

Mega-tool.
Why all the hate on england? 
I heard their southern neighbors aren't that bad either

Right proper lads
Brexit
Hrvatska!!!!!!!
Hope they win the world cup as well
They are going to party! In South America when the team wins big they sometimes call a national holiday, and no one goes to work.
Come on now Croatia beat those cheating French bastards!!!
As a half English half Irish I'm both happy and sad depending on my present company 
I feel so loved, thank you :')
Hvala. We love you too!
They sure are.
A little late to the party, but I will say this tho... 

This newly founded brotherhood is fucking dope!

Cheers/≈Ωivjeli
As a naive American, why are so many Irish cheering this hard for Croatia? Is it just anti English feelings?
Go Croatia!

Love, America
That's it. Life savings on Croatia to win!
They're going home! They're going home! They're going, England's going home!
I love Croatia and everything about it
I'm not trying to jinx it, but it also would be very funny if Brussels, err, the EU, I mean, Belgium could make third place.
Fuck all's coming home
Am fucking delighted for them. 
English person here with a question... is it because of that French handball? or because you don't like England? or do you just happen to like Croatia?

PS obviously I'm disappointed by the result but at the same time thrilled to have made it this far and relieved we didn't go out to a horrible side like Columbia, I'm fully behind Croatia too now :)
‚ÄúSeriously; fuck the English‚Äù - every Irishman ever
Well done Croatia <3

Applying for mortgage in a time of gouging rents...

With my current rent I am essentialy paying for a mortgage of a house worth just over 600k. It's utterly insane
My current rent is ‚Ç¨1100 in Limerick. I saved up 11000 for a 110000 house. Not getting it coz my employer receiving wage subsidy.
Yup the mortgage situation in this country is a fucking joke. My parents, having enough for a deposit and with 40k extra savings, plus having paid a rent of nearly a thousand euro for over 8 years at the same house, were given a mortgage of 120k... For that, you might be able to buy a fucking shed in Knocknaheeney
Ways to get a mortgage:

1. Be rich - have rich parents who‚Äôll give you hopefully > 10% of the value of the property
2. Be married - don‚Äôt make enough money? Just double your money by committing the rest of your life to someone you‚Äôve known for on average 4 years.
3. Buy in a place very far from where you work! With the M1 and everything Cavan really is only 40 minutes from Dublin City centre. That‚Äôs a lie it takes 1 hour and 20 and you‚Äôll do that twice a day for 35 years so that‚Äôs only 24‚Äô266 hours or 1‚Äô011 days straight commuting... pfft piece of piss basically 
4. Buy something you couldn‚Äôt possibly live in! Who doesn‚Äôt like a fixer-upper? You‚Äôll spend the next 15-20 years putting all your spare money and time into a home you can‚Äôt even raise a family in! Don‚Äôt worry though upon resale you‚Äôll make exactly 0 profit! #score! 
5. Buy in a real shit hole. Gangland violence is kind of exotic if you close your eyes and just listen to the loud banging and sirens you could be anywhere; Mexico or Colombia! Now doesn‚Äôt that sound lovely??? The great news is your house will be broken in to multiple times and there‚Äôll be no incentive for you to ever waste your money on an expensive car because you better believe that will be taken for a joyride and burnt out. Another great benefit here is that there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôd want to raise a family is such a horrible area - more savings!! 

Don‚Äôt know what all the moaning is about if you want a house you can get one!
When I first moved away, if I got homesick, I'd always look at Daft etc and see the utterly fucked state of renting.

Some of these comments on how much people are paying are crazy.
There is absolutely no solution to the housing crisis that isn't building loads more houses, which takes time. All these other efforts simply drive up prices or benefit smaller interest groups.

I think we need two things:

a) A realistic national development plan to increase housing density in the right places, backed up with the right infrastructure, to be built in a sustainable, livable way. This will take time and a lot of money, but this is the root cause and we need the investment. I personally don't care who builds them (private v public) once they are built and at a reasonable standard. The government should however be responsible for ensuring the infrastructure is in place (transport and education principally).

b) To deal with the rent market, there needs to be a database of all rental properties (including current and historic rent prices, at least by year), tied to Eircode, open to the public. It should be an offense to advertise or rent a property without including the database ID. This database should also include information regarding who rented the property and for how long/much, but this should not be available to the public. This would prevent much of the BS around massive rent hikes, folks getting kicked out and then listing at a higher price immediately, overcrowding and so on.
100% mortgage crowd are the worst
I'll give you 2 bits of advice my buddy gave me when I was going for a mortgage.

1. Go to your Ma & Da and ask for (I mean get) ‚Ç¨50k. If your the baby of the house and/or the only boy make sure to ask your Ma first.

2. Go to your inlaws (if you don't have any, get some) and ask for ‚Ç¨75k and tell them that your parents gave you ‚Ç¨75k. If they love their kid at all they'll match  what the other parents gave or hopefully 1 up them.

Now ya got the ‚Ç¨125k, add that to the 3k you saved over the last 4 years and your golden lad.

Bonus points if you can get the parents to pay off your outstanding loans as well to make the application go smoother.
My friends actually told me a while back 'Hey, it's easier to just buy instead of rent'.

Yes, but you are also 2 people and had to wait months for your mortgage to get approved etc.
I just managed to buy a house just outside Cork. Was given notice in my old rented house so had no choice but to move. Was looking at renting again but it was 1400-1600 a month, it is just ridiculous. My mortgage is 750 a month now in the same town.
Tbf the ability to save a lump sum is important when buying a house as in addition to paying the mortgage you also need to be able to maintain the property, pay for insurance, etc, which takes even more cash.

Also, let's not forget that it's a government agency (the central bank) which created the mortgage lending rules and requirements.
Do you think if it was easier for the banks to reposses homes they would be more risk tolerant? 

Like we don't want to go back to the days of a 120% mortgage being given for a wink and a handshake but the requirements these days are insane, I had to change my lifestyle to get a mortgage, like stop doing contract work and getting a permanent joband that's with a lot of money from relatives.
I think the problem is not just the mortgage (and yes, banks more or less take the rent into account, but only to an extent), the problem is that when you buy the house you have extra expenses that you don't have while renting.

But that's only a wild guess.
As a 29 year old renter in Dublin, I‚Äôm sick of this shit...I feel we have been let down in this regard by previous generations. I‚Äôm most afraid of the fact that the main issue that this problem stems from is human nature - as a species, we don‚Äôt seem to be capable of long-term planning when short-term gain is possible.
banks are the biggest scam of all .
being poor is expensive
Too much money is to be made in the current situation for it to change.
I've come to terms with the fact that I will never own a house. Renting (and working) until I die is just something I've come to accept because no miracle will fix the utterly fucked up situation we live in.
[deleted]
Can you get a mortgage if you‚Äôre paid by a company abroad ? Like if I move back to Ireland tomorrow from North America and take my job with me, what‚Äôs the story there ?
What if house prices fall?
What if you lose your job?
What if there are unexpected expensive repairs necessary for the house?

There are good reasons why the bank asks for you to have some cash saved up when you buy a house.
Same situation here in Norway. It sucks.
Some people seem to have a sense of entitlement that the banks are assholes if they don't give a mortgage for whatever the applicant wants. Well after seeing what happened in 2008 - 2011, I'd personally like to see the banks being cautious, particularly when you have the dark clouds of Covid and Brexit on the horizon.

The reason for the deposit is that house prices can fluctuate. Negative equity is a terrible thing, to be avoided at all costs. A 10% deposit is a reasonable safeguard against it, and perfectly common sense.
The thing is, even though we save up loads while paying that rent, my husband is temporarily on covid payments, so we can't get a mortgage.
*cries in brokeness*
I've manage to do it. Just before COVID. Count myself lucky. But I'm not in Dublin. I basically don't understand how anyone can live in Dublin.
Imagine a monthly mortgage payment of only ‚Ç¨500... or a nice place to rent for only ‚Ç¨1,000...
Well this is what happens when you allow house prices to boom at a crazy rate for literal decades. The people who bought beforehand suddenly have extremely valuable assets just by being lucky to be born in the right generation and everyone after them has to put in 7-8x the money just to get the same thing. 

I have friend working as senior manager at a big 4 accounting firm in Dublin who is living like a student with a load of roommates just to scrape up enough deposit to buy a small house in commuting range of Dublin. Meanwhile his parents bought their (far bigger) house off the single income of his from his Dad working on a factory floor.  

How is it at all fair that someone who by all accounts should be 'well off' has to put up with this shit? 

You have an entire class of people who contribute exacty nil to the economy and are in a position to leech off the productivity of the younger working generation because they have no choice.
I feel powerless and it hurts. Some days just Fuck this place.
I've got 25,000 saved and ready to go but still can't get a place because Dublin is fucking expensive and there's no exceptions in the banks atm
As someone who had the bank laugh at them and said they could only afford a shed at my income level (despite paying more in rent than the monthly mortgage payment would have been on a house I saw) this has brought up some old wounds I thought I had forgotten.

Thanks, I hate it
I would advise everyone who wants to buy a house to go to a mortgage broker, they will cut through all the crap with you.

They will tell you straight, save this amount a month, for x years come back to me then.

In 2014 I moved to a small apt in a bad place and saved an extra 500 a month that went straight into a savings acc, I stopped my pension payments for 2 years. I stopped taking holidays, I stopped going for friday pints. I axed every non-essential cost including the car (bike instead) It's not easy I was not happy, but I did it.

Waiting for the state to solve this will take longer than a few years of destitution.

I know it would be nice if things were as easy as they were in 2006, I was a week away from getting a 500k docklands apt with no cash in the bank 2k on a credit card and less than a month away from a redundancy package.

During those times of destitution I craved how easy it seemed back in the celtic tiger, but if we throw easy credit now it will just make it harder to achieve your goal later.

But if everyone really wants to drop the lending rules I'll be happy too, because it will drive up the price of the house I am in.
I came here from /r/all but it's the same here in Canada. I feel like our real estate market never really crashed after 2008, it just kept climbing as wealthy investors snatched up houses they hardly ever visit.
I went to the bank and with my single person salary of 33k and even with a 20k deposit they could only give me 115k plus my 20k makes 135k. I have been paying 700‚Ç¨ rent per month and that mortgage would be 400‚Ç¨. They wouldn't be willing to give me more money eventhough I can clearly pay more money and still have enough to save 1000‚Ç¨ a month....  


For that price you don't even find one bedrooms in Ballymun.  


The prices are overinflated and until they start building like crazy nothing will change and people will fuck off Ireland or just pay a cunt to rent a box sized bedroom
This is one of the biggest political issues of our age but it will never be championed by politicians because people are  selfish. Homeowners will never support a policy that will devalue their ¬£500,000 homes that they payed 100,000 for, and neither will the kids that get that home for free. And that's before we even consider landlords.

I grew up poor, lived in council houses to a single mother. It'll be years and years before im able to afford a mortgage because saving is very slow. I pay my rent and a portion of my mum's. I've never missed a rent payment. I'm in my 30s, I'll be lucky to have bought a home before 40. Rents and deposits required rise almost as quickly as I can save it.
Renting just means you're paying for that guy's mortgage till the property is worth enough to resell
Yep it‚Äôs ducking crap there use to be a big cap between rent and mortgage and it was that gap you used to save for a house now. If you are renting you are literally paying off some else‚Äôs mortgage when did rent climb as high if not higher than a mortgage repayments. And how did we let it get to this
I understand the frustration but the deposit is not purely to give reassurance that you can pay it back. I think It's also security so that the bank will recoup the loan in the event that you have to sell your house because you fail to repay and can't work out alternative arrangements.

If the house is sold, the bank gets repaid first, then you get whatever's left over. By putting down a deposit the bank has a smaller loan to claw back and so it's less likely to suffer if the house is sold for a low value.
The banks here will consider rent when calculating how much you can afford to repay but you still need savings
It's the banks fault not landlords they are more concerned about what you have rather than what you can prove that you can consistently pay for.. I had to take out a loan under my dad's name to get the down-payment which we can afford to pay along with the mortgage easily as it is still 200 less than our old rent
I'm just curious, is this something that happens in other countries or just Ireland? I have anxiety thinking about how I'll never have my own home until my 30's or 40's, and I refuse to pay high rent to pay someone else's mortgage.
That's now how it works it allllll.

The 25k counts as a hedge against falling house prices.
I dont know how I will ever be able to afford a property of my own for my family. I work full-time (And study part-time). My other half has health issues and is unable to work for prolonged periods but staying at home saves us a small fortune on childcare. We have a child with another on the way. Renting a property that is not worth how much I have paid in rent over the last 5 years... But its either that or be homeless.. No inheritance for either of us as she was an orphan and my parents never owned a property. 

We are considering leaving Ireland, as it seems to be our only option and starting with a clean slate somewhere else.
Yeah cos 100% mortgages really worked out well.

Clowns. There are plenty of shitty subreddits to moan about things costing money in, don't ruin this subreddit too. This is the second bullshit tweet in a week saying the same thing.
It sucks, but they are looking at two somewhat different things.

Mortgage lenders want to know you can pay this back for 25-30 years which is why self employed people have difficulty. Lenders are also looking to make sure the person has some equity in the house and invested in keeping it - from a financial position if they give a 100% loan and the house value declines (which is largely outside both lender and borrowers control - someone in negative equity without any equity in the property has the chance to just walk away leaving the loss to the bank.

That is at least one way that banks fail.
My mortgage is roughly 800/month. Similar house in the same estate are rented starting from 1200/month. This is indeed crazy. 

(I'm consider myself very lucky I was able to buy, it took us a few rough years of hard savings to save to 5% of the house value).
Just get some richer parents
Rent of 1650. Cr√®che fees of 1300. So demonstrated ability to consistently repay. Still a ball ache to get a mortgage for standard 3 bed house.
Can someone clarify a few things? the tax a landlord would be paying on the rent. Using an example based of my manager here in Scotland. He moved in with missus rented his flat, said 40% of rent was straight tax, he then had insurance and maintenance mostly covered by 10%  (some years more some less) so for simplicity 500 quid mortgage would be 1000 rent required to break even. When they broke up he couldn't just evict the renter (not sure that's the case at home) and had to rent a one bed himself. There was no profit made just a hopeful future profit. Renter in his case was paying around double his mortgage. Don't think anyones winning in this situation for about 30 years.

We do have an incentive here called mid market rent, where developers get a break on building apartments of decent spec that they can't sell but rent for cheaper. So say build 2 blocks sell a 2 bed for 200k in one block but second block is a 2 bed of same spec they rent for like 600 quid much like fancy social housing thats not social housing if that makes sense. does that exist at home yet?
I think this says more about the cost of rent than it does about applying for a mortgage...
Usually the amount a mortgage applicant has saved has no bearing on the amount a bank is prepared to loan them (at least that what EBS and KBC told me when applying for a mortgage). 

An approval is principal is mostly subject to the applicant(s) gross wage, existing loans/debits and ability to make monthly payments (either into a savings account, or as rent on an existing property).
How about your salary is taken into account but the fact that your second household salary basically pays the creche so you can work isn't taken into account should that salary be gone. That's really not justified. And I'm talking about the 3x your salary thing.
As a Dutch dude: is the same over here too. *Sadface*
Don't feel bad for him](https://media1.tenor.com/images/2fac1008857b636edbbb4155168423aa/tenor.gif?itemid=15329042)
My rent is 1200 dollars a month, my landlords mortgage is 400 a month. 

This dude makes 800 dollars a month off me.
What I think is really messed up is even some "affordable" homes really arent.  Like you manage to pay rent for 750 a month and you look at a 45,000 home which will have really low payments (somewhere in the $250 rang) and it is refurbished by HUD and tgey will be like "we need proof of income of $2000 a month minimum."  

I can afford the mortgage.  I can afford my car.  I can afford the utilities.  But no I don't make $2000 a month so I guess I'll go pay my $600 to share a house with 2 roommates.
The banks are rushed off their feet at the moment. Everyone has applied for a mortgage.
Also absurd is the situation I have been in trying to refinance my mortgage.  "Your debt to income is just barely too high" "Well haven't I been paying you the current mortgage for 10 years with no problem? The new payment will be lower." I don't get it.
We have to stop expecting basic rights in the world. You‚Äôre worthless if you don‚Äôt participate in this despicable system
You have to put down a lump sum deposit to rent, it makes sense that a bank loaning you a few hundred thousand would want a bit bigger of a deposit.
It's makes sense that if you can pay a higher rent than the mortgage payment you should be viable, but rent in most cases are for a year's commitment.  A home is a 15-30 year commitment.  The bank's issue is that it's a longer time period of commitment so they expect history, collateral, and backing.

The current requirements for home ownership is ridiculous, but the previous loan requirements were more stupid.  There needs to be a fair medium for loan requirements, fair cost homes, and better first time home deductions and benefits.
You might want to try to find a cheaper place to live.  You'd be surprised how much money you save when you leverage against a day-to-day expense you can more easily control: transportation costs.  You can save money by carpooling, or living in an area where daily tasks like work or shopping don't require long or daily commutes.

People also acquire debt incorrectly, using debt to cover purchases when no cash is available, when all purchases should be made to debt, and only to your available liquid assets.  Pay your debts every month with your cash and next thing you know, that 10% you need to buy a house is more like 3%, because you show banks you can pay your debts and not let them linger, who then trust you to pay your debts when you have less upfront money.
Can you leverage debt as dangerously in Ireland as you can in America? Most shit American landlords will have property and a load of debt. They refinance every few years to get *another* loan to buy *another* property. Then when anything goes wrong, they can‚Äôt do anything about it because their income (our rent) is going directly into their debt. So they‚Äôre property rich but have no cash. 

Also doesn‚Äôt help that we‚Äôre on the opposite spectrum when it comes to mortgages. If you own so much as a shoe you can get a dang loan, it seems.
I thought her profile picture was Qui Gon Jinn for a second.
A down payment is a motivator to keep paying after the first two month. It jogs that whole sunk cost fallacy thing. People tend to not want to "lose" their effort, and 20% finished on the house is a lot of effort. It works or they wouldn't do it. They would much rather get the extra interest on that 20% of the loan.
When you buy a house you're responsible for its maitanance, not just the mortgage. It depends on the age of the house and several other factors but home upkeep plus the mortgage can easily exceed what you pay for rent on an apartment. $500/mo wiggle room is pretty good, but replacing a furnace for example is about a $4000 expense, so you hope you don't get slapped with an upfront expense. 

Keep in mind, rental homed are often only profitable because the property was bought at a far lower cost, maybe due to being a foreclosure or being bought several years prior. Buying a house in the same neighborhood, you will have a higher mortgage (most likely) than the person who rents the house down the street, so you may end up breaking about even in terms of monthly expenses. It just depends on what the market has been like in the last several years.
In my area, rent is far cheaper than a mortgage. The only incentive to buy is to be able to improve the place I live in and build equity. I‚Äôm in a moderately expensive apartment, and rent is about 20% cheaper than the mortgage on any home I can afford.
I used to think about it this way too, but the deposit is actually to lower the banks risk overall on the investment. If the market goes down at least there is a little margin for them. Also owning a house is expensive! Expect to pay 2-5% of the homes value per year to keep it going.
Fuckin hell, I wish mortgages were 500 a month here :(
Lol. ¬£25000.
Ireland still has a higher home owner rate than the United States.

Yes in city. My max is 120000 for now. Looking for a 3 bed house.
Yes and you have to get a loan to be able to get a loan.
This right here! I can guarantee $X a month, *GUARANTEE* IT!!! I been paying it for the last 10yrs. But I don‚Äôt have $200k to put down on a house so too bad, so sad.
Perhaps, the problem isn't so much *"with"* the housing market [https://youtu.be/qihG6AGjkRk](https://youtu.be/qihG6AGjkRk)
Yes well, that would be the celtic boom era's fault!
what screwed up is how much house prices jumped in 10 years...i bought a place for $300k 10 years ago. Its now worth about $850k for a 900 sq ft condo in Toronto. Im glad i got lucky and was able to buy when i did but for people a few years younger than me its very unfair.

How can a condos price go up half a million dollars when salaries on average have barely jumped at all? Part of that answer is foreign buyers pumping their money into our housing market. 

Seriously unfair when some people have 4 -5 properties and others can't buy a starter home though they did everything society asked them too. Got an education, got a job, started a family but have to rent a 600 sq foot condo because a house that was 400k 10 years ago is now over a million.
We need to abolish Real Estate Investment Trusts.
Your rhyme just made my day at work üòÇ
Ahhh yes, I feel this pain!
That's gonna be a while before that's solved.
SPEAK.
American here and this is true for us too. lol
Apparently it‚Äôs existed for some time now.
Fractional reserve banking.

If you are paying those absurd rents the market is telling you to move.
Golden handcuffs. I hate, I despise, but I acknowledge the golden handcuffs.
If my rent is 1500 what fucking house might that be a mortgage for I wonder 
Ugh
Banks should be owned by the state
The 25,000 down payment on a house isn't there to reassure the bank that you have the ability to pay 500 a month. It is there so that you have an investment that would make you think twice about walking away from the house if you are unable to pay the mortgage. You wouldn't just be damaging your credit score, you would also be losing the 25k. It encourages people to stick it out
Too real from u.s.

I been paying 1200 rent for years now and have no problem paying 20% down , but they can't trust me to pay less than 1200 because my income this year was less because i got laid off because of corona virus. 

I could pay my mortage for two years on 20% down. Luckily, they haven't gogued my rents yet ........
I have rented the house I am in for nearly 11 years. The landlord paid 50k for it a couple of decades ago, so I have essentially paid the cost of the house plus 20% in the time  I have lived here. 

Can I get a mortgage? Nope. Even though they could see that I have paid 60k over a decade without an issue when working part time as a single parent for a lot of it, and am earning almost triple what I was making back then... 

All I can do now is save, save, save and hope I save enough to buy a house sometime before I die. Probably the week before, to be fair.
That was the point of buying 09-12, so you could have someone pay your mortgage in 5-10 year while also making 500-1000usd above taxes, insurance and maintenance a month.
Down-payment is to reduce the % of borrowed money in the property in case you get bust and they gotta sell it - possibly at a discount - to get their money back.

The reason mortgages are so cheap is precisely because the financing institution assures to have minimal risk exposure at any given moment.
Japan:

‚ÄúHey if you want to move into this apartment you need to pay 3 months of rent up front. And the first month of rent on time as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk um...will it be refunded to me at some point?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
Obviously if you're not saving enough you're spending money too much on luxuries like food, electricity and the likes...it's not like you need those things anyway, right?
Tbis is exactly my situation. Going to save and save and save as hard as i can fir the next year ir two and hopefully ill have enough for a deposit
*sigh*

This cuts deep
My rent was literally twice what my mortgage is. Renting was my greatest barrier to escaping lifelong poverty.
Just because you pay your rent on time doesn't mean your paying other bills on time.
I get it but ultimately the bank wants you to take the risk of the prices dropping. They want you to have a deposit.
Ive basically just given up on owning a house.
FUCKING THANKYOU! I‚Äôve been trying to get a mortgage for months an am absolutely baffled by how much I could save a month on rent, etc. but how few people there are willing to help us!
This is literally why I live in a van, I payed rent for 10 years whilst working away staying in hotels Monday to Friday, rent was such a waste of money for me
The current mortgages system in this country doesn't really favour or work for anybody - but we have to avoid the madness of the past, so here we are
Rented for like 8 years and never missed a payment.  Credit history was ruined by a barclaycard rep at uni for a ¬£300 limit and a popcorn maker I never got.  Mum had always said she had 10k saved for me when she passes away.  I built up the courage to asked her for it for a deposit. No problems.  The rates high, but at least its gradually going down and the area is nice.  Also whatever DIY I do here adds to our pockets.

Been putting away ¬£50 a month for the child on off so she doesn't face what I went through.
We went sale agreed today. Never thought I‚Äôd get here. Woohoo.
Have this issue myself. Nothing is made to help you, don't know how anyone in this generation can afford a house without money from parents.

I can't get a mortgage above ¬£100,000 and that's with myself and my wife. Solely because my "contract" is 20 hours even though I do 35+ overtime every week. Nope, fuck you.
Two major issues with housing here are...

1) There are few places people want to actually live, we have  5 or 6 cities. Two of which have a half decent infrastructure with decentish transport. The majority of people will move to Dublin at some point in their lives, for college or work, and we can't sustain them. Realistically it doesn't matter if we build up or out,, we need to diversify our economy and start making other cities more appealing to young professionals, counties like Limerick and Galway have a higher level of affordable housing but are probably lacking in infrastructure. They also need to be joined up far better with transport.


2) New build homes are ludicrously over priced.. I know there is some incentive to buy a new build in terms of cash back, but the starting prices are ridiculously high in areas, and then in other areas we don't build them. I've seen new builds going up for near a million in Dublin. I really want to know what bank is giving that mortgage ans who the fuck can pay it back. Mortgages on offer are fairly low compared to what people need, personally I would argue this is a good thing because it protects people from over spending. 

The government (any of them) and their lack of understanding around housing is plain to see with the homeless situation. Rather than spend a bit more in the short term and build new accomodation, they would rather spread that payment and rent hotel rooms for homeless people... If they are stuck renting what hope do we have they will fix it.

It was a shame that Sinn F√©in didn't get into power because I think Eoin O Broin was always very sensible speaking about housing and would have had a decent attempt at bringing through new legislation.

Unfortunately with the Pandemic, I can't see it changing the situation. The issue isn't actually money, it's supply and demand, we simply don't have enough houses and prices won't drop when the demand is so high. All we can hope for is that banks shoot themselves in the foot and can't offer our mortgages because applicants don't meet the criteria. It's bonkers that a bank can look at a couple who pay 1000 a month in rent and refuse them a mortgage that would be far less than the rent they pay.
I‚Äôm trying to refinance my house. Perfect credit. Paying mortgage for 3 years, no missed payments. Made $450k last year. I lost my job, but wife still works. She makes $35k/year. We have $150k in the bank.
We don‚Äôt qualify for a new loan. Even though it‚Äôs basically the same loan at a lower rate. So....ya, that doesn‚Äôt make sense.
Not Irish, but same problems in the states.
Same here in the my state except rent is 1300 and a mortgage is probably 900 but local property taxes are 400 a month so its painful to keep any money.
Banks actually do look at your rent and other expenditures, credit history, assets, investments (you know...all that money stuff banks are good at). They also look at your income and unless you make 80k (that can be split between you and your partner or spouse in any fraction you want) and that gives them a pretty clear picture.

Not saying rent isn't too high in this country. Just wanted to be fair to banks. They're the best!
As long as landlords exist tenants and citizens shall not be spared from their evils.
The problem being housing is a business that earns the country a lot of money. 

Its scummy and i hate this about Ireland but its very hard to undo when every union is looking for pay rises and half the county depends on rent as a type of substitute pension. 

My solution:

Ban Renting or ban buying, having both means they can play off each other. 

Homes as a business means that supply will never meet demand because that's bad business. 

I support constructing homes for money but after its made its really milked, a home sold over and over and rented time and time again... the same middle men make a fortune every time it passes from one person to the other. The banks love when people sell cause they get to remortgage it for the next sap. 

Its a toxic and disgusting system that most are oblivious to.

IMO:

Entirely state funded construction building more than required and getting everyone to pay into the system, more tax every year depending on the required home, you could have tax brackets with different income levels, no rent, no ownership, no middle men sucking the money out of peoples pockets.

The problem is you will never get elected telling the country you want to take their nest egg away.

Sorry.

The system is broken but it still kinda works so nobody wants to change it.
So I just remortgaged. 

Now, I lowered my monthly payment by $350. 

I have six figures in my savings account. 

I have a full time job. 

When remortgaging they still kept asking for dumb shit for 3 months. 

'oh. Can you send your W-2 from 2016 please?' 

Why the fuck do you want to see how much I earned 4 fucking years ago? What bearing does that have in my ability to pay my mortgage currently? 

Then they slap points on me because the mortgage took 120 days to close. Becuase they kept dragging it on with pointless requests. 

Fucking pricks.
So fucking true. I'm in this situation right now. Makes me want to pull my hair out in frustration. üò¢
Okay but that isn't why the bank wants a deposit. Round numbers incoming:

If you want to buy a ¬£100,000 house and I lend you ¬£100,000, if you defer and get repossessed after paying back ¬£5,000 I now have to sell for at least ¬£95,000, and then I'd still be making a loss due to costs.

The deposit is to reassure the lender that if you can't/don't repay they don't make a loss.

Edit: don't get me wrong, the system stinks. Adding middlemen and resellers/landlords only makes it harder for the productive people of any economy.
Homeless ppl are just saving up for that first mortgage
Not a great analogy, if you don't pay the bank they have to get back a hell of a lot more than the landlord who's only out 1000$ then evicts you. That's why down payments exist.
I pay $2200 aud in Melbourne lol
We are renting and paying 1650 for an apartment which is worth 255000. The house price to rent ratio is insane
‚Ç¨1100 would actually be a massive win if i could find rent that low! Sign of the times!
AIB took rent payment history as proof of ability to pay and acknowledged that it was higher than the mortgage would be. They even said  with home insurance and other monthly fees  it's still less than the rent I payed. I was amazed at how logical and fair it seemed.
stupids banks ..how can you ever buy a house ..idiots
Ireland has nothing, there‚Äôs little entertainment other than drinking.  The weathers bleak and the scenery gets boring after a while.  You say thousands but it‚Äôs likely hundreds however the United States receives well over 1 million immigrants every year.  I have everything here, more entertainment than I could possibly absorb.  I have 8 movie theaters within a 30 minute drive, And 100 other options such as pool halls, bowling alleys, laser tag and the list goes on and on.  NBA, NFL, NHL, NBL, and the top forming artists of the world all at my fingertips.  For what I making for hours worked $ I can fly to Vegas and back for a weekend of fun.  Sorry dude you got nothing.
I moved to Australia for a year in 2009. Had taken out a credit card.  Did pay it back in the beginning but as money got tight I stopped paying it back (I know, young and foolish). I can't remember the limit, maybe ‚Ç¨600 or something like that. I moved back home to a different address after a year in Oz. I'd genuinely forgotten all about it until reading this thread. I'm hoping to buy a house with my wife in the next few years. My question is, will there be some sort of record of this if I try to get a mortgage out? Been saving for a deposit the last few years. 10 years renting,  I'd love for us to have our own place, but worried that my actions from 10 years ago is gonna come back to bite me.
Stuck in this loop as we speak ! 

Because, the banks lend big sums of money to the estate agents giving them the monopoly on rents the banks don‚Äôt want to give you the mortgage !! 

They will lower house prices in the next 6 months because the market is about to pop! 

People that want to own there own home that work 2 jobs will never be able too 

And the landlords own 5,10,15 places 
Rent caps have to happen 

People cannot survive having to pay 2k a month on rent !
Even if you suddenly couldn't afford it for some extended period of time, it's not like a candy bar. They can resell your house, they aren't at a loss, just a temporary gap in payments. Most mortgages are 15 and 30 year anyway, what's 6 months?
That reminds me conversation I had in bank with manager. He I can't afford mortgage I told hi yes I can I pay double amount on rent. Then he said but you don't have security on house I said I'm Polish not a snail can put house on my back and fuck off to Poland.
This!
¬£1000 a month seems good, the rent my family pays is ¬£2,100 a month (the cheapest we could get) which is my mums entire monthly wage, we physically could not live without income support because my mum is a single parent. The house we lived in before was ¬£1,800 and it wasn‚Äôt even safe to live in (holes in walls to outside, no heating, asbestos, polystyrene ceiling tiles and the ceiling in my brothers room collapsed).
The newly crowned largest English speaking country in the EU!

What's all the sandy coloured areas around Drogheda, Kildare, Wexford and Cork from?
‚ÄúCrowned‚Äù... please no.
It's also the largest Irish speaking country in the EU
Congratulations from germany.

Btw. Berlin is now the city with the most inhabitants in the EU.
Is it just me or does ireland look like a koala thats looking behind it
A dubious honour.
What‚Äôs the craic bruv innit
*cries in Scottish*
Fun fact: there isn‚Äôt any English speaking country in EU that has English as its first language. Our first language is Irish but we all probably know that
Love the way in the picture you can see the grey of urban areas, the yellow of crop fields amd green of pastures
Is √© b√©arla an teanga as an diabhail
This picture always saddens me, such a lack of forest coverage. For a country that used to have over 70% of its land area covered by mixed deciduous - coniferous forests, it's tragic to see what's left today.
Why are we proud of this?
Is Ireland really that fucking green everywhere?
Not sure but you Irish, are certainly the best company abroad so Cheers!
Ironic.
That ain‚Äôt something to be proud of. Poor Gaeilge
It's my island
Shame were speaking the wrong language as our first
Ireland has to have one o the best shapes goin
I‚Äôd love to visit Ireland. One day before retirement.
Vive la Quebec libre!

No wait...
Tutorial island FTW!
Glad we still have you Ireland. <3
It was already the best English speaking country in the EU, so why not make it the largest.
United Ireland when?

Yours, 

Someone who'd rather be in the EU than get fingered then ignored by the mainland.
Might Northern Ireland vote to leave the UK and join the rest of the island and the EU?
Guys? We love you? Don't leave us too?

Scotland can come too!

Sincerely, a german!
Ireland is absolutely gorgeous form outer space
Learn French, lads. Fast.
Not exactly anything to be proud of
A great bunch of lads.
Way to go! - From Mars
And the accent *american guy heart eyes*
All the atms in Europe have started putting irish flags next the english options now
Well, time we learn to speak Irish again boys
I really wish Ireland spoke more Irish. It's a beautiful language. As long as they don't lose their (from my perspective) Irish accent, I'll be a little bit happier than I can be.
"Enjoy it while you can."

\- Scotland
I‚Äôm so goddamn proud of you guys.
Not technically true because there's plenty of other countries in the EU that have more English speakers like Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Approximately 90% of the Dutch population can speak English. 

I suppose Ireland has the most *native* English speakers of any EU nation but that barely matters.
Yet we are still forced to learn Irish. Sigh.
Not somthing to be proud of
Not really. There are more English speakers in other EU countries for sure.

And celebrating something the British did to this country is rather dubious as well.
Not sure it‚Äôs something we should be overly proud of but it seems like a bit of an own goal on the UKs behalf
Nothing to be proud of.
Kinda sad really when you think about it....
Gotta love that border down the Irish Sea though. NI just needs to have a think about joining the EU again (officially) and we‚Äôll be on the right path. If Turkish Cyprus can be in the EU then why can‚Äôt NI?
I can feel the unionist tears
Without the English, it would probably have a higher population than it did before the famine too.
It is also the largest Irish speaking country. 

I hate how speaking English is the honour. We lost our language at the hands of the British long ago, and although parts are struggling to reclaim our native tongue, most Gen X people have no Irish at all.  Feels like we lost our culture.
Not really something to brag about considering our language was ripped away from us and part of our country is still occupied by a foreign country
I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs a positive?
So proud of this we're so great
in the comic to get the cock
Where‚Äôs the Shannon in this pic tho
Christ that's a big plot of cattle fields
Yuppp the lads
Will last a couple of years until Scotland takes the title.
Congretz to you all!
Is trua sin.
You guys must be so proud
Doesn‚Äôt the Netherlands have a 90% English speaking population
Apart from the top bit..
I live in the West and my town still gets less rain than both NYC and Sydney. And only 300mm more per year than Dublin.
Irish English might as well be Latin.  Sure some sounds overlap but...
Can you really consider it English though
Take back the north part already. Been letting em get away with it for too long if ya ask me
And the home of the best spirits!
We finally did it!!!
Looks like a Buffalo
Northern Ireland isn't in the EU though.
lol stupid brits!
If accurate that‚Äôs a really cool map
Reluctantly
So I'm just an ignorant American and Brexit confused the living fuck out of me for a bit there but is there going to be a border in the north now? Or does one half support the union and the other doesnt?
 Honestly just trying to see what happens now?
The koala aka Ireland
Anybody live on those islands off the west coast of the island? I've always wondered what that must be like.
Scrap me
Does Brexit mean a United Ireland? Sorry if this is a stupid question
Largest unwilling English  speaking nation
There's a little corner of that not in the EU
american here hiding from treacherous political news here and abroad. does anyone have a link or can explain what happened with the peace treaty issues regarding brexit and how those were resolved? ultimately what the bullet points are for what this means for ireland.
I'd say there's a lot of countries still in the EU that speak English better than us haha
No crown on this head son......... üòë
It's also the only one
An bhfuil s√© sin ceart?
This makes me sad
I love Ireland so much!
Still looks like a Koala hugging an invisible tree to me
The largest one on the Internet.
Long live the king!!
This isn't something we should be happy about
How is this the first place I hear of this
Which one?
The main English speakers do be speaking Hiberno English now.
Hi, I‚Äôm American and I‚Äôve no idea what‚Äôs going on. Anyone care to help out a dummy?
The new fortnite map looks wild bruh
Scotland?
Well this is bittersweet..
Yes
COYBIG
Hey what‚Äôs that big fucking lake up there called?
Important we also mention *overseas tax shelter* too.
I think they should change it back to Gaelic.  Seriously. As a big FU to England.
The largest English-speaking country in the EU but their day will never come
Bless
Do need a passport to go to Ireland and Northern Ireland now?
Well, congrats guys
Whooooop Whoooooooop üòÅ!!
Is this... Twitter?
Host question: Right now is there a realistic chance of a united Ireland?
Might want to cut off the top 3rd of that if you want to be accurate....
Legend says if you squint really closely you can see the Ireland-UK hard border.
This is fucking embarrassing...
Looks like bowser
Yay?
\*cries as gaeilge\*
What's that lake up in the north called. That's a big ol' lake
ireland looks like a nugget
Ah the good old Lisdoonvarna festival and chatting up the yanks who wanted to hear Irish ‚òòÔ∏è

That's bad
Because they stole our language . Stole our land we can change it
Ha hah! Fuck the English Wankers and their stupid language, it‚Äôs ours now. Nkw We just need to actuslly speak Irish.
How insensitive saying crowned
Feces turns from brown to a light tan colour with enough sunlight, look at all those spots of tan coloured shit.
That's not a good thing
And if the English hadn‚Äôt taken our native tongue we‚Äôd be the largest Irish speaking country in the EU. Not much to be proud of
Let's recap.     Thoses knee caps.............
Great work, yet again celebrating the default prize
Fun fact turn ireland 90 degrees to the left and it looks kinda like a dog
Landlords when they have to give back a deposit.

Had a landlord in Galway try this year's ago. We were warned about him by a lot of people so we took photos of the entire apartment the day we moved in.
When we went in to his office to collect our deposit after moving out he tried to withhold half of it for damages to the property. We made him list all the damage then took out the photos of the same damage that was present the day we moved in. 
He flipped out, called us smug little fucks etc. 
We got the cheque for the full amount.
The last place I rented my dog ate a chunk out of the carpet. He was about 7 at the time, and had never done anything like that in his life, but it happened. I read that dogs can do that sometimes if they're feeling ill and don't have any grass to eat?

Anyway, when I moved out I explained it to the property manager and they still gave me roughly half of my security deposit back. To this day I still wonder how that happened.
Anyone who ever has this issue should call Threshold, they get it sorted more often than not.
Previous landlord in 2014 withheld our deposit for a few weeks until an inspection was completed. We chased for days until I noticed a deposit in my account on a Friday. We only got 70% of the deposit back as they said the apartment needed to be deep cleaned. 

Total bullshit as we cleaned the place from top to bottom and since it was small it wasn‚Äôt a massive task. This wasn‚Äôt just a sweep up but proper clean of floors and every nook and cranny.

When I asked for a receipt of the works since we were effectively paying, I was just emailed two lines that it took 2 contract cleaners an hour at ‚Ç¨120 each to clean the place.

We fought this but just ended up at a dead end. Any further calls and emails and I was told I would be reported for harassment. 

Days later I saw the apartment on daft for sale.
My first landlord said we were the best tenants he ever had because we installed new lights with his permission and smoke alarm. We cleared out his backyard and cleaned it which was disgusting when we moved in. We scrubbed the entire house top to bottom on the first and last day. The house was immaculate. Far better than when we moved in. On our last day he kept it because he saw a bottle of whiskey and bag of tayto in the sitting room that we had on our last day in the house. He said we threw a party. 700 kept each from 7 of us. He told us to fuck off or he'll call the guards when we hassled him for it. Vile disgusting old man. We warned the new tenants by letter when we saw somebody move in.
Used to live in in a rental in drumcondra with three others. Absolute gobshite of a landlady refused to give us our deposits back when we moved out. She'd left a load of her (dead) mother's stuff in the storage areas and in some of the  cupboards. The garden shed was chockablock with stuff. We all received this pompous and patronising letter from her saying some of her mother's things were missing and that we'd damaged the house, especially the carpet in the sitting room. Absolute rubbish. No joke, one item she'd listed as missing was a spare toilet brush that was supposedly in the garden shed. I was livid, rang her up and said I'd provide her with a replacement second-hand toilet brush no problem, and that as I'd been living in the house two years and the carpet was 10 years old, I'd pay for a fifth of its value. Then I looked up the RTB and guess what, no listing for the house. Rang her up again and said we weren't happy with the amount she was giving us back and that we were bringing it to the RTB. She amazingly changed her tune pretty quickly and we received most of the deposit back.
A few years back I shared a house in college with 4 others. The house should have been condemned - we used to wake up to puddles of water on the window sills, the heating physically couldn't heat the house because it was so old, and it was sinking into the foundations so badly you'd get motion sickness when you walked into the sitting room. 

We came back from the winter break and the house was absolutely coated in black mold, as in every ceiling surface in the house. Knowing that the landlord would do absolutely nothing to fix it, I got into them and told them I was moving out. A week later, they told me they'd need to keep the deposit because I was breaking the lease,  sent them the photos and mentioned my imaginary solicitor. Bank transferred the whole deposit immediately
This happened to me. No sign of my deposit being returned the day I was moving out despite having Had plenty of conversations with them ahead of time but got loads of excuses and promises I would ‚Äúget it soon‚Äù etc. So when I moved out I locked the bedroom door and took the room key plus the front door key. They didn‚Äôt like that! ‚ÄúHow am I supposed to show and the room and find a new tenant if I can‚Äôt get into the room?!‚Äù I was like, well when I get my deposit back, you‚Äôll get the keys! I got my money back within a few days üëåüèº
Renting in Galway, we were asked to move out of our apartment as it was up for sale in 2017, The management company gave us 8 weeks notice. We managed to find somewhere else 6 weeks later. Deep cleaned the apartment (only 2 adults) so left it in perfect condition. The day comes to give back the keys, they decided to try keep two weeks rent from the deposit as we are moving out early???? Argued that they asked us to leave!! I‚Äôd say they try this shit on people all the time, luckily I had a friend barrister write up a beautifully worded letter, needless to say the deposit was miraculously put in to our account the next day. Next landlord was a pure gent, not all bad but fuck these scammers!!
Can you imagine a world without ~~lawyers~~ landlords?
[removed]
Landlord tried to charge us 20 euro for a broken wok handle.
We got the wok free with an Uncle Ben's offer...
I had one issue with a deposit and the prtb were on it sharpish enough, got the full amount back.

Otherwise I've found private landlords the most likely to try shenanigans, bigger let's and commercial landlords always just transferred it back no hassle.
If they‚Äôre dodgy, just tell them to take the last month‚Äôs rent out of the security deposit and get gone. 

It‚Äôs even quite a lot of hassle to evict a tenant 10 months overdue on their rent with no excuse. 

It‚Äôs basically impossible to chase a tenant who‚Äôs technically paid up, already or soon to move out, and hasn‚Äôt actually done any damage to the place. 

not giving you a reference is about their only comeback - but if they were gonna be a dick and lie about you damaging their property, they were probably gonna not give you one anyway.
Some of them don't see it as something they have, they see it as a fee you have already paid. And in their minds they are not "giving it back", they are "giving up their own money".
YOU, YOU, left a pencil on your floor, that is a ‚Ç¨50 cleaning fee and lead tip damaged the carpet, so do not think you are getting your ‚Ç¨300 deposit back.
I'm a landlord. I've only withheld a deposit once. My tenants had cats (against the lease) which destroyed the carpet. I had to have the carpet pulled and the wood beneath treated for cat urine odor. It was disgusting. The security deposit didn't even come close to covering the required work.

We're not all scumbags, but yeah, a lot of us are.
Friendly reminder to all new tenants: take pictures of everything when you first move in, and save the sh1te to de clowd!
I had one landlord, a property company who's manager left and stole all the utility money and everyone's in the complex's rent from them.   He also stole and destroyed all the lease documents.  When I moved out they tried to say they didn't have the lease so they had no way of knowing my deposit.  I had a copy.   They repeatedly refused saying it could have been doctored.  Then they hit me with a cleaning fee, because I had no deposit.

I took them to court and they said they had no deposit on record for me.  They didn't mention the fact that their guy had absconded with them.   I gathered affidavits from a ton of people in the complex, who all had the same damage deposit I had.   When I produced my copy of the lease, along with the affidavits,  When the judge found out they lied he got REAL pissed off and they had to fork out a ton of money, let's just say I got double my damage deposit back, and a generous amount of money for my troubles.    The judge also told them if they tried the same thing on any other renters he'd swear out a warrant and put them behind bars.  I put up fliers on everyone's doors telling them of my victory and not let the bastards cheat them out of anything.
I must have been lucky to never have to deal with this kind of BS with past landlords.
Got stung once before so the next time we let the electricity bill go unpaid so we had some leverage when it came to getting the deposit back. And surely enough the deposit was called into question toward the end. It was quite the standoff for a week or two with all parties eventually going to the post office to pay the outstanding bill and then them handing over the deposit. It was funny how there was zero problems all year until it came to handing back the deposit. They were mildly pissed and embarrassed. It felt good to get that deposit back.
I had a landlord who I never even met. I was half way through my second year of renting when he decided to evict us. Which was totally a breach of our contract.

We had never once damaged any property or anything and paid rent without fail on time every single month.

It took about 20 phone calls and emails over almost three months to get my deposit back.

They tried everything from constantly pretending to be out of the office despite reception saying they were in, to stating that they had no proof that I even paid the deposit despite me showing them the signed receipt.

Shower o' cunts.
This gives me a lot of anxiety
Best use of this meme that I've seen!
I live in California. My landlord tried to keep my deposit, but there‚Äôs a law that says they lose all rights to it (the full amount of the deposit) after 21 days AND you can sue them for up to three times the amount. So when my $300 deposit that somehow had been reduced to only $94 when I moved out - of a brand new apartment (one-year lease), like, we were the first people to live in it - with no explanation as to what ate up the $206 never arrived, I called the landlord. They said they mailed a check, it must have gotten lost in the mail, blah blah blah, five phone calls and three months later, I still didn‚Äôt have a single one of the four checks they said they mailed. So I sued, and my $300 turned into a $1,050 claim (including filing fees and whatnot). The idiots had the balls to call and try to settle it out of court, saying they‚Äôd write me a check for $1,000. I was like, you can‚Äôt even send me a check for $94, I certainly don‚Äôt trust you to send one for $1,000 without being ordered to do so! So we went to court, I won, and had a fancy fancy fancy dinner out to celebrate!l Landlords are pond scum...
Don't understand why landlords do this. I mean you know exactly where their house is? I wouldn't be the type to do it nor would I advocate it but they could easily find the outside of their house damaged to the tune of your deposit
Love their faces when you ask for the interest. It is law that anyone holding your money pays you interest.
Just lost ‚Ç¨500 deposit and I never saw the apartment. I'm working with the gardi to try and catch the scammer
This doesn't even just apply to Ireland. I feel like landlords are like this basically everywhere
Idk if its like this in other countries, but in Norway it's law that deposits must be placed in a special shared deposit account (which is in the leasers name primarily), where neither party can take it out without consent(through the bank as an intermediary)

Makes it very hard to just keep the money. As it is the lenders by default and the landlord has to prove his case if he wishes to take anything.

law, in norwegian. https://lovdata.no/lov/1999-03-26-17/¬ß3-5
Reddit has an interesting relationship with landlords
We really need something similar to the UK where the deposit is given to a third party who hold on to it and manage disputes. 

The entire regulations around renting need a massive overhaul and actual enforcement towards rule breakers.
What's the legality of just not paying the last months rent anticipating that they aren't going to return the deposit?
Landlord once tried to keep half of our 1200 deposit because there were cigarettes outside our bedroom window... They came from the students upstairs smh
So apt for me at the moment. Leaving the house Paddy's weekend after like 7 years. Been a good relationship but I know he hasnt been paying tax since we paid half in cash each month so at least can threaten reporting him to Revenue if he tries to screw us.
Had a landlord try to get me to *pay back my deposit after she returned it*, after moving out, after her inspecting the apartment, and after a new tenant moved in ... apparently the new tenant complained it wasn‚Äôt clean (it was, and she had verified) so she had the gall to text me asking to pay it back. I never laughed so loud in my life.
Remember when landlords caused the potato famine?  Fuck landlords, they're all leeches
I've always left my apartment spotless and been charged cleaning fees and at the same time I've never moved in to a clean apartment. Con artists
>Me realising you get back your deposit after you move out. 

Wait.. you guys are getting paid?
I wish they would just call it a fee so we can all move on with our lives. It‚Äôs the fucking lying that is the worst.
When I was faced with returning the deposit. I was SO HAPPY that I didn‚Äôt have to work on the property!!! I really hated removing piss covered carpets.  I‚Äôd much rather give the money back.
as a landlord in the us. there are strict laws around this, basically overruled by the lease tho

utilities and supplies taken out

never had to give anyone a cleaning fee until this most recent group of tenants... fucking ruining my floors ruining my walls. It honestly makes me want to cry.
There should really be a mandatory escrow service for rental deposits so you might have a hope in hell of getting them back at the end.
It happens in America too. Drives me crazy because it is one of the better common example of humans being scummy. Because, it's really theft.
facts the spend the money and think they don't have to give it back to you
Fuck landlords, this is why I bought despite a few years ago getting a new job. People were like you need to figure out if the job works out, I was like I make enough and have enough of a deposit, I'm fucking done with landlords.
They've probably been making interest off of it
i lived in a 5 bedroom house where the deposit was passed on from tenant to tenant over a few years. we all decided to move out at the same time and asked for the deposit back and he said no way, he got a deposit years ago. so we just didn't pay the final month's rent and fecked off.
Pro move: don't pay your last months rent when you move.
I've had 5 different landlords and not one hasn't given the full deposit back.
Best thing to do here is tell them you're using your deposit as your last month's rent, what are they gonna do? Kick you out?
I had a landlord claim I didn't give notice and had to change locks and show the apartment in the middle of the month and such. When I went to the office and asked how they knew I was even gone, he turned to his secretary and asked the same question. To which she replied "he have notice and turned in his keys..."

He knew he was in trouble then... Gave me half and claimed the other for screens and painting ( I will admit, I did smoke in there and my cats did damage the screens)
They always try it. Had to take 2 to the PRTB to get deposits back. First one I ever had took 30 quid out of a deposit for cleaning a stain on the bedroom carpet, a stain that was there when i moved in and had covered with a rug.

I actually ended up becoming friendly with the next person who rented that room. Unsurprisingly the stain had never been cleaned and I warned her what they would try and pull, sure enough they did. That stain has probably made that landlord hundreds
Have we ever been able to discern what service a landlord provides?    

Maintenance people do maintenance, groundskeepers keep the place neat etc. Property managers do the paperwork and coordinate all these things for the building, yet landlords do ... nothing. In "exchange" for this, they get at least a third of your income. Something seems fucky. ü§î
#ALL LANDLORDS ARE PARASITES
hose connected straight to the tap
I like how everyone still pays returnable deposits.  In Chicago, due to laws about escrow, most landlords have switched to non-refundable 'move-in fees'.  They don't help you move in, mind you, but they collect all the same.  Our landlord only charged 600$, most charge just under a month's rent to keep it legal.  We didn't get charged for pets however, so it's a trade off in that situation.
They always find a way to charge you for cleaning the carpet when they were gonna do it anyways.
My landlord‚Äôs tried illegally raising my rent every year in the last 4 years I‚Äôve been here, not following the law with regards to notice, (rent increase from next month, etc) and always gets really nasty when I draw attention to it or ask for anything - roof isn‚Äôt leaking, I reported it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it‚Äôs your fuckin‚Äô house mate. Anyway..

I won‚Äôt pay the last month‚Äôs rent; let her keep the deposit. I don‚Äôt trust her, she‚Äôs proven she can‚Äôt be reused time and again, I‚Äôve it all in writing. If she kicks up I‚Äôll report her to the RTB.
Had a landlord say the $400 deposit would be returned soon after moving out. One month of badgering and I'm told it'll be another month. Another month goes by and I get a check for $125. I go to the office and demand a list of everything they took money out for...their response? "It was just pretty dirty".  I say, "well, I have pictures of the day I moved in and the day I moved out, would you like to go through them with me?". They say, "well, actually I guess it was pretty clean". Check shows up for $350 a week later.
Never had this issue.
My college landlord got forclosed on and stole every ones deposit. Then Tried to go bankrupt on it. In another state.

One tenent did the work to find us a lawyer on contingency. We all ended up settling for 1.5x our deposits.
Rented a place from a lady who said that if my roommates and I showed up to clean after we moved out we would get our full deposit back. All of us showed up at 8am on a Saturday and worked for 4 hours to earn our deposit back.
don't get me started. renting through an agency. independent inventory report. report gets sent to the landlord for his suggested deductions. according to the report there was no damage. took me 30 min to read it. i've been waiting four weeks for this cunt to get back to the agency. next week i'll see if i can send a complaint to DPS.

and yeah, i'm aware a month is nothing, compared to what others sometimes have to wait. insane.
I always thought it was there so I don‚Äôt have to worry when I accidentally break something in my apartment, at least that‚Äôs why I use it
I had a landlord tell me before I moved out that he wasn‚Äôt giving me my deposit back because of all the ‚Äúroutine maintenance‚Äù he had to do when I was a tenant. I don‚Äôt have time to deal with that bullshit and the apartment had metal pipes that were on their last leg, I had a BUNCH of gallium that I had used for an education program that I didn‚Äôt need anymore so I went into the attic and scraped that shit on all of the pipes going to the hot water heater. 

I did this out of anger not considering the consequences to the next tenant but luckily like a week later I got a text asking me ‚Äúwere there any pipes leaking when you moved out?‚Äù And he went on to say that a bunch of pipes in the attic have leaked causing a crazy amount of damage. And I said ‚Äúthat sucks, at-least you have my deposit to pay for it‚Äù Last text I ever got from him was along the lines of ‚Äúthis is going to cost 10x your deposit‚Äù

Tldr: didn‚Äôt get deposit back so put gallium on pipes causing 10-20k in damage.
States and canada here, only gotten my damage deposit back from 1 place, and I had to bust balls to get it. I'm sure I could have bust balls to get it at other places to. But threatening to charge every land lord with thief and them fullly knowing the 700 damage deposit is worth the hassel for court. It can be pretty hard to get it
I like to refer to it as 'final months rent'.
This is a universal thing unfortunately.
It is just bad for business. I would want students to get their deposit back. I know they are hungry.

How the hell does this have so many upvotes
it's all fun and games until you have to get small claims court involved
If you pay by direct debit you can request that your bank refund last eight weeks payments, no questions asked.

We rented out our house as wife had to move to England to finish training.  The tenants completely destroyed a love seat couch that my wife had bought for ‚Ç¨450.  We said we'd take ‚Ç¨50 off the deposit.  The former tenant threatened to go through the prtb and harrassed my wife who was pregnant at work.  Eventually, she gave back the ‚Ç¨50.  He was a rich kid too, parents owned the business he worked in.  Absolute dickhead, really wanted to kick the shit out of him.
Mao had some good ideas.
My landlord seems to be a nice person, but the friendly tone started changing once she discovered that the rental prices in the city have increased and are constantly increasing. She is pushing a higher price after one year despite me paying already a pretty high price for the newly built studio and complimenting me for being a good tennant numerous times. While we do seem to be likeminded in terms of general cleanliness and good care of the living place, her obsession with small scratches and spots on surfaces makes me feel some unease prior she starts the inspection. Hope it goes well.üòå
Ha, the last one I got back was more than two years later, shocked.
Word. Happens here too. Power corrupts absolutely and all that. Shame it happens as soon as someone has just a lol but over someone else
It depends on the state on when interest is accumulated. However, some states also do not require interest paid or only if they manage X amount of properties. Check your state laws. But it is funny as hell when you ask for the extra amount. 

My last landlord owed me an extra $800 in interest. Took him to court and he had to pay me and accrued fines..lol.
Had a landlord try to claim $250 (Australian) for cleaning after we‚Äôd moved out. We had had the place professionally cleaned and had already delivered copies of the receipts (cost us $120). We were livid and demanded a copy of their invoice. The claim suddenly disappeared.
Came here from r/all .  This shit is super common in the US too.  I used to do a super thorough cleaning when leaving a place, but now I just vacuum and basic clean the counters/fridge etc.  They always find some bs to charge you for.
Seems only fair, right?
All my landlords have been sound.
Am landlord of one small apartment in the US. Have rented it to about 10 people. Never kept a penny of a deposit (knock wood).
Annnnnd....its gone!
I am in similar situation right now. I had a fixed contract for one year for a room in a flat. I decided to break contract and move out as I had big problems with flatmate in apartment. When I was contracting the leet with landlord, he said I can break the contract provided I give him enough notice period to find someone new. He said one month. The problem is that it was not put into contract. Now when I moved out and gave him agreed upon notice he is holding the deposit and stating that he wants to deduct the incurred cost of letting the flat again. I was thinking of contacting RTB to see which options do I have :/
Hell even the rent itself
hehehe
This is all landlords
My last landlord didn't have my deposit so I agreed to 2 months free rent, I never cleaned and left them a 500 pound hida bed couch they had to dispose of in return. I don't feel bad because they were selling the property and made 250,000.
We have prime time.
So glad I live in a province where it's illegal for landlords to take a damage deposit.
/u/RepostSleuthBot
I've fortunately only had 1 bad landlord and that was in college.  Dude was great to deal with until it was time to move and move out.  Months went by without getting our deposit back.  He tried to say that it was dirty, it wasn't and I roomed with who I did because we were both neat people.  We left that place better than he gave it to us and we had to send him certified letters threatening legal action if he didn't send the deposits back.
We had a good run lads.

(For ease of accounting, let's pretend security deposits are $100)

When I was moving out of my first apartment, I cleaned the shit out of it to get some of my security deposit. Now, I had accidentally put a hole in my bedroom door so I know it would be dinged for that. So I get the final paperwork and it has an itemized bill for the security deposit:

-$55.40 for damage the door (yep, ok, expected that.)

-$44.60 for cleaning the grout... What?!

Meanwhile...

My friend moved into an apartment and got a waived security deposit special. A couple of us would end up at his place most nights after the bars and we tore that place up. Holes in the wall, window blinds busted up, that sort of thing.

He moves out and he got his $100 security deposit, which he didn't pay, back in full. 

Since then, I just assumed the deposit was sunk and cleaned the apartment only enough to not embarrass myself.
This meme format is goty.
I‚Äôm currently dealing with the worst landlord ever. Refuses to fix anything, can‚Äôt wait to get fucked over on my security deposit from the holes HIS WORKERS put in my walls and never came to fix.
As a "landlord".... holy hell the pictures I get of the semi annual inspections.... these assholes dont give 1 shit about my property, they are absolutely wrecking it, so I can see some of the attitude that I have gotten when renting before. 

Also, I still agree damages need to be itemized fairly and give back what isnt used. And dont count wear and tear, for instance the carpet is about fucked, but then again it is pretty much at its life cycle. So I cant really blame them too much.
Life pro tip for everyone in Ireland, if your landlord is dodgy and you don't think he will pay you your deposit back, bring it up with him/her before you pay your last months deposit. As for a written guarantee. If you can't get one, tell them to take the deposit off your last months rent üëå
Can you  not pay last month and tell lanlord to use your deposit instead?
Landlords are greedy parasites. Of course they won't give you your money back.
**TL;DR at the bottom**

Dang that sucks. I lived in this place I Hawaii and one day this cockroach came into oir place (cockroaches are plentiful in Hawaii so we always tried to live on the high floors since they usually don't crawl up), and my wife freaked out and unscrewed a bottle of bleach and pooted it on the carpet. Well it obviously didn't kill it and I ended up just stomping on it. 

Anyways, there's this big bleach stain on the carpet and I'm like shit, that's going to come out of the deposit. Then my wife gets the idea to try to use *"chapter paint"* to fix the color. But insty of getting this carpet paint (really a dye) she gets regular paint and tries to paint ove this bleach spot. 

Well it turns a pale greenish brown that looked like a mix of baby throw up and shit. So that looked even better. 

So we still had a decent bit of time we were going to live there so I didn't worry. Then when were were about to move I decided I was going to try to replace that area with a similar peice. Got the supplies and carpet price. Watched a couple videos to make sure I knew a little bit of what I was doing. Made the swap and it looked... well shit honestly. I'm like fuck it. We're losing the deposit, I got a chance to try something I hadn't done before and learned some things I could try if I ever had to do it again (wasn't going to try to find and chunk an even bigger hole in the carpet). 

Well day comes for inspection and I'm standing on the shower patch job as my wife walks around with her. She says everything is good and we all walk out together with me trailing and shutting the door behind and then inspector for the company locks the door. 

We luckily got the deposit in the mail about 2 weeks later after we had already moved back to the mainland so I am not sure if they re checked or maybe were anning on replacing it anyways. 

I don't really feel bad because when we first got there the carpet was old and shit. The nails popped up and I stubbed the shit out of my toe. When I called them they sent a repair main to nail in the old nails that weren‚Äôt holding anymore. So I could care less. 

**TL;DR:** Living in Hawaii, wife poorer bleach on a cockroach and damaged the carpet. Tried to paint it and made worse. I tried to patch it and it wasn‚Äôt that great. Stood on the patch and hid the evidence and got our deposit back.
A different perspective.... I rented out my condo to a professional couple for about 2 years, they had hung about 40 paintings and pictures up in the condo, I counted about 110+ nail holes in the walls.  I also told them they could deep clean the apartment on their own or I could hire a company and take it out of the damage deposit, they said they would deep clean.  There is a difference between tidying up, and cleaning an entire apartment from top to bottom, ie: washing all the walls, doing a legit carpet cleaning, cleaning all the cupboards, appliances, inside the fridge, all the floors, dusting, vacuuming, wiping all the windowsills, cleaning the windows, etc etc.   They also moved out about 2 days late after the lease was done. 


Granted they were ok tenants, always paid rent, didn't absolutely trash the place, but the whole point of the damage deposit is to take care of things like the 110 nail holes in the wall, sanding and repainting the bedroom door frame their cat had scratched the ever living fuck out of, random wear and tear, damage to appliances like dings and scratches and shit, and having to hire a company to actually top to bottom clean the fuck out of the place to make it ready for the next renters etc etc.  


I wasn't a dick, but in hindsight I probably should have kept **MORE** of the damage deposit than I did, I'm sure in their minds I was a greedy asshole though for not giving them their full deposit back...
Landlords like that are the worst because when places DO get trashed its harder for the mom and pops who just rent out their spare bedrooms or whatever to come out okay
No longer a landlord. But loved it when we were able to give it all back. Minimal down time between re-leasing. All the crazy people that you meet on the train, bus, pub, stores RENT PLACES. If they are pigs in public, they are pigs on steroids in their dwellings. 
Dirty diapers strewn about, on carpets or hardwood floors, shit and piss everywhere. Wallpaper torn off. Appliances broken. You may hate having to rent, and therefore hate landlords.

 Buy us looking at you isn't very sweet, either. Our last 2 were pretty good, and lasted 7 plus years each, but people are even worse than before. So we sold out. 

People who bought doubled the rent, and we probably should have had it higher. Which is sad all around, as I was young once, and a renter.
Oh so landlords are parasitic scum over there too eh?
I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like in Ireland but in metropolitan Canada, the house or apartment you get back has a 50/50 chance of being completely destroyed including shit smeared on stiff and used needles all around and three months worth of garbage stacked up around the house. Some people aren‚Äôt civilized. 

One if my favourite was the Nigerian who did their cooking on the living room floor. The stove was untouched.
Don't tarnish all landlords with the same brush. My parents rented a houses out, had a tenant who didn't pay rent for 4 months, causes 10K worth of damage and the only way to get rid of her was to give her deposit back!
I'm in the same boat right now. My old landlord claims to have already mailed me the damage deposit check with the necessary deductions. It's been almost a month now and yet I see no sign of it.
Before I moved out of an apartment I shampooed the carpet and cleaned everything. In the living room was a small, old world bronze colored, chandelier. I remember thinking I could just give it a quick wipe down. One swipe and I noticed a lot of dirt coming off. i kept wiping and all the "bronze" came off, the chandelier was silver. When the landlord did a walk-through  I pointed this out to him, he just stared at it like he couldn't believe it had been that dirty. I never received my down payment. He cited he had to get it "professionally" cleaned.
It's amazingly reassuring, I have the dumb today.
this happens across the pond in America too lol
If being a landlord is as lucrative as the typical Redditor thinks it is? They should team up with each other - pool a few million - buy property and show actual landlords how things should be.

By now you've spent a couple a seconds thinking about that possibility. Your instincts reveal that this business plan will never happen. Because... Angsty Redditors gather 'round the amorphous blob of Greeeen Envy - and *bow to it.* It's so much easier than working for a living and planning for a future worth living in.

The real tragedy is that for most Redditors, nothing else that's measurably significant will ever happen in their lives either. Their enemy is *themselves* \- because they harbor a resentment towards becoming an *irrefutably successful adult.*
I would be absolutely thrilled to give back my tenants' deposits. Most of them have cost me far more than the amount of the deposit. Also, there is the always the possibility of some asshole costing me thousands because they completely fucked it up. I can go after them in court, but it either isnt worth it for my legal costs if its a few hundred more. Or, they simply don't have the money, so I'm not getting anything anyway. Such is life.
